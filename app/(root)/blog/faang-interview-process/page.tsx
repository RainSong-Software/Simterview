        <h2>Understanding the FAANG Technical Interview Pipeline</h2>
        <p>
          Landing a software engineering job at one of the FAANG companies (Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) or other top tech firms 
          is a significant career milestone. These companies are known for rigorous interview processes designed to identify the most skilled and promising candidates.
        </p>
        <p>
          While each company has unique elements to their hiring process, there's a common structure that most follow. This article breaks down that 
          process from initial application to offer, providing insights into what to expect and how to prepare for each stage.
        </p>

        <h2>The FAANG Interview Process Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The typical interview process consists of:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Resume screening and application review</li>
          <li>Initial technical screening (online assessment or phone screen)</li>
          <li>Technical phone/video interviews (1-2 rounds)</li>
          <li>Onsite interviews (4-6 rounds)</li>
          <li>Hiring committee review</li>
          <li>Offer negotiation</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The entire process typically takes 3-8 weeks, though it can vary significantly based on hiring urgency, candidate availability, and company-specific processes.
        </p>

        <h2>Stage 1: Resume Screening and Application</h2>
        <p>
          Before any interviews begin, your resume must make it through an initial screening. At FAANG companies, each role can receive hundreds or even thousands of applications.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What happens during this stage:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Your resume is reviewed by an automated system (ATS) and/or recruiters</li>
          <li>Applications are filtered based on qualifications, experience, education, and keywords</li>
          <li>Selected candidates move forward to technical screening</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Tips for passing resume screening:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Quantify achievements</strong>: Include metrics that demonstrate impact (e.g., "Reduced page load time by 40%")</li>
          <li><strong>Use relevant keywords</strong>: Include technologies, languages, and frameworks mentioned in the job description</li>
          <li><strong>Showcase projects</strong>: Highlight relevant work or personal projects that demonstrate technical skills</li>
          <li><strong>Tailor your resume</strong>: Customize your resume for the specific role you're applying to</li>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold">Sample Technical Phone Interview Question</h4>
          <p className="italic text-slate-300">"Design a data structure that supports the following operations in O(1) time:</p>
          <ol className="text-slate-300">
            <li>Insert(x): Adds an element x to the collection.</li>
            <li>Remove(x): Removes an element x from the collection if present.</li>
            <li>GetRandom(): Returns a random element from the current collection, with all elements having equal probability of being returned."</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mt-4 text-slate-300"><strong>Approach:</strong> This problem requires combining multiple data structures. A HashMap provides O(1) insertion and removal, while an array allows for O(1) random access. The trick is maintaining array indices in the HashMap to allow for efficient removal without breaking the random selection capability.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Stage 4: Onsite Interviews</h2>
        <p>
          The onsite interview (which may be conducted virtually) is the most comprehensive phase of the interview process. It typically

          Remember that interviewing is a skill that improves with practice. Even if you don't succeed on your first attempt at a FAANG company, 
          the preparation process and interview experience are valuable for your growth as a software engineer and will set you up for future opportunities.

          Most importantly, approach the process with confidence in your abilities and a growth mindset. Technical skills can be learned, 
          and interview performance can be improved with deliberate practice and perseverance.
