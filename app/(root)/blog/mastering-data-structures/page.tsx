        <h2>Why Data Structures Matter in Technical Interviews</h2>
        <p>
          When preparing for software engineering interviews, particularly at companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or Meta, 
          data structures form the foundation of almost every technical problem you'll encounter. Your ability to select and efficiently 
          implement the right data structure often makes the difference between solving a problem optimally and exceeding time or space constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the most frequently tested data structures in technical interviews, common patterns, 
          time and space complexity considerations, and practical implementation strategies.
        </p>

        <h2>Arrays and Strings</h2>
        <p>
          Arrays are the most fundamental data structure and appear in approximately 40% of technical interview questions. The key operations to master include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Two-pointer technique</strong>: Used for problems involving searching, reversing, or palindrome verification</li>
          <li><strong>Sliding window</strong>: For substring problems and contiguous sequence challenges</li>
          <li><strong>Prefix sums</strong>: For range query problems and cumulative calculations</li>
          <li><strong>Binary search on sorted arrays</strong>: For efficient searching with O(log n) time complexity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When working with arrays in interviews, always clarify if the array is sorted, as this opens up more efficient algorithms. 
          Also, be mindful of off-by-one errors, which are common pitfalls in array manipulation.
        </p>

        <h2>Linked Lists</h2>
        <p>
          Linked lists appear in approximately 20% of technical interviews, with a focus on these key techniques:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fast and slow pointers</strong>: For cycle detection, finding the middle element, or the nth node from the end</li>
          <li><strong>Reversing a linked list</strong>: A common interview question that tests your understanding of pointer manipulation</li>
          <li><strong>Merging sorted lists</strong>: Often used to test understanding of recursion and iterative approaches</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When approaching linked list problems, always consider edge cases like empty lists or lists with only one node. 
          Drawing out the pointers' movements for small examples can help visualize your solution before coding.
        </p>

        <h2>Trees and Graphs</h2>
        <p>
          Tree and graph problems appear in approximately 25% of technical interviews at FAANG companies, with these key concepts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Binary tree traversals</strong>: Inorder, preorder, postorder, and level-order</li>
          <li><strong>Binary search trees</strong>: Understanding the properties and operations of BSTs</li>
          <li><strong>Depth-first search (DFS)</strong>: Used for pathfinding, topological sorting, and cycle detection</li>
          <li><strong>Breadth-first search (BFS)</strong>: Used for shortest path problems and level-order traversals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When working with trees and graphs, recursion is often a natural approach, but be aware of stack overflow 
          risks for very deep trees. Always consider iterative approaches using stacks or queues as alternatives.
        </p>

        <h2>Hash Tables</h2>
        <p>
          Hash tables (dictionaries in Python, objects in JavaScript, maps in Java) are essential for optimizing 
          lookup operations and appear in roughly 30% of technical interviews. Key applications include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Two-sum and its variations</strong>: Using hash tables to find pairs with specific properties</li>
          <li><strong>Frequency counting</strong>: Tracking occurrences of elements</li>
          <li><strong>Caching results</strong>: Memoization for dynamic programming problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Hash tables provide average O(1) lookup, insertion, and deletion, making them powerful tools for optimizing brute force solutions. 
          Always consider a hash table when you need to check for existence or count occurrences efficiently.
        </p>

        <h2>Heaps/Priority Queues</h2>
        <p>
          Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that appear in about 15% of technical interviews, particularly in problems involving:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Top K elements</strong>: Finding the k largest or smallest elements</li>
          <li><strong>Merge K sorted arrays/lists</strong>: Efficiently combining multiple sorted sequences</li>
          <li><strong>Median maintenance</strong>: Keeping track of the median in a stream of numbers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Min-heaps and max-heaps provide O(log n) insertion and extraction operations, making them efficient for problems requiring 
          partial sorting or access to extreme values. In many high-level languages, heaps are implemented as priority queues.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Implementation Tips</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond understanding the theoretical properties of data structures, these practical tips will help you in technical interviews:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start with a clear verbal explanation of your approach before coding</li>
          <li>Always analyze the time and space complexity of your solution</li>
          <li>Consider edge cases: empty structures, single elements, maximum values</li>
          <li>Use built-in library functions when appropriate, but understand their implementation</li>
          <li>Practice converting between different data structures (e.g., array to tree, graph to adjacency list)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Practice Data Structures for Interviews</h2>
        <p>
          To effectively prepare for technical interviews, follow these strategies:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Study each data structure's properties, operations, and complexities</li>
          <li>Solve 5-10 problems for each data structure type</li>
          <li>Practice explaining your thought process and solution verbally</li>
          <li>Review common patterns across similar problems</li>
          <li>Simulate real interview conditions with timed practice sessions</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Mastering data structures is a fundamental requirement for success in technical interviews. By understanding the strengths, 
          limitations, and applications of each structure, you'll be better equipped to select the right tool for each problem. 
          Remember that technical interviews assess not only your coding ability but also your problem-solving approach and communication skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regular practice with diverse problems, combined with structured review and mock interviews, will help you build the confidence
