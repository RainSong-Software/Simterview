Since a node does not have reference to its previous node, we must store its previous element beforehand. We also need another pointer to store the next node before changing the reference. Do not forget to return the new head reference at the end!\n\nImplementation\n\n\nComplexity analysis\n\nTime complexity : O(n).\nAssume that n is the list's length, the time complexity is O(n).\n\nSpace complexity : O(1).\n\nApproach 2: Recursive\nIntuition\n\nThe recursive version is slightly trickier and the key is to work backwards. Assume that the rest of the list had already been reversed, now how do we reverse the front part? Let's assume the list is: n1 \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 nk-1 \u2192 nk \u2192 nk+1 \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 nm \u2192 \u00d8\n\nAssume from node nk+1 to nm had been reversed and we are at node nk.\n\nn1 \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 nk-1 \u2192 nk \u2192 nk+1 \u2190 \u2026 \u2190 nm\n\nWe want nk+1's next node to point to nk.\n\nSo,\n\nnk.next.next = nk;\n\nBe very careful that n1's next must point to \u00d8. If you forget about this, your linked list will have a cycle in it. This bug could be caught if you test your code with a linked list of size 2.\n\nImplementation\n\n\nComplexity Analysis\n\nTime complexity : O(n).\nAssume that n is the list's length, the time complexity is O(n).\n\nSpace complexity : O(n).\nThe extra space comes from implicit stack space due to recursion. The recursion could go up to n levels deep.\n      "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hey there, welcome to the mock interview. Have you done any coding interviews before?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Once or twice."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So that's the interview. We'll call it an interview, even though typically in an interview you wouldn't be specifically asked to reverse a linked list, but here, that's what we're going to what we're going to do to see if Ben Awad can do that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wait, why would they ask me this in an interview? You were preparing me for interviews."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, usually reversing a linked list is something that you need to know for interviews, but it usually won't be a stand-alone question. It might be part of another question, or it might be, um, you know, like, you you might need a variation of reversing a linked list for a question, but just reversing a linked list is usually a little bit too easy for an interview question. But we are only doing one question today, so it's fine."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Alright guys, I'm here."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes. What language do you want to use?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Let's do Python. Let's do Python."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Python, okay. Alright. So, Ben, listen, the the prompt of the question is basically reverse a linked list. So you're going to be given a linked list. A linked list, here you're going to be given the head of the linked list specifically. And the linked list is going to have uh, basically linked list nodes, right? And each node is going to have an integer value, as well as a next pointer that points to the next node. In fact, I can actually give you the uh, struct for what this looks like, give you one second."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I need to know the guy. Reverse."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, this is what your linked list is going to look like. This is the type of the head that you're given. And you have to reverse it. And I can tell you right off the bat that doing head.reverse is not going to work."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That's a bummer. So, so you're going to give me hints and stuff, or am I just on my own here? Is this this is how how do they do that at Google?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, so the question is, do you need hints? Or do you need to ask questions? Like, are you do you have all the information that you need right now to reverse this linked list?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "So do I get bonus points if I do it all by myself?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maybe."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So am I going to get a score at the end of this and you can tell me whether I made it into Google or not?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you want, yes. Or I'll tell you if you're ready if you're ready to interview in Google."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Alright, this is this is exciting. Alright, we're about to we're about to find out. Well, we're going to say while true here. So, we're going to loop through the list and we're going to get the next element. head.next. This is going to be my next guy. And basically what I want to do, and we also need to keep track of the current, right? So let me we do something like that. All right, so I need to like this is my my next guy. So okay, let me give you a visual. This is what I'm thinking about right now. So, we got A, then we got B, and he's touching C, right? And so I need to turn that into okay, if I'm reversing the list, you want this, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes. And it should be mutating the actual list that you were given. So you should not be creating Oh, you won't let me make a new one? No. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Ooh, you know, mutation is not cool, bro. Haskell likes immutable data types."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I agree. I agree. Mutation is not cool. It's the source of a lot of bugs, but sometimes you do have to mutate data. This is one of those times."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I don't know, that's pretty suss, but okay. So C's going to point at A, and B's going to point at A. So let me let's see. Now C's got to point to B. Yeah, let me let's make this a D. D would be here. So C's going to be pointing backwards, and then this one's got to point all the way here. Okay, I I think I knew what I was doing when I started, but I don't know how I'm going to handle this last D guy. We'll have to see him. And just to to clarify the the the last D node points to none in Python. And here the last A node should point to none. Big D. Alright, so we're going to say our next guy here, and so we're going to say current.next. Actually, we're going to say next_guy.next is equal to the current node. So that would give B is now pointing at A, which is what we want. And then we need to go on to the next one and do the next thing. So that would then go here. So, all right, so if we go, I'm currently A, right? Cur is A. I'm telling it, I want it next. So next_guy is B. And so, I need to stick. Also, I need to keep track of what B was pointing at. So I can't just say next_guy.next. So we'll say next_next_guy. Okay. And that's next_guy.next. Before we, you know, wipe it out. And so then we set like current is equal to Do I want to set current equal to maybe next_next_guy. Actually, why don't I keep track of two nodes? That's what I'll do. Like a previous or some garbage. Some garbage. Why is the previous? Oh, this is what this is 100% what I do actually. Cuz then that's how I set it to none. So deaf, this is actually definitely how it works. So current is this, so I know at the end current.next is equal to previous. Alright, this is the only thing I know right now. Oh, you guys still have the thing? You guys need the thing where I like uh, command slash and it comments them all out? We'll do with the manual I. Oh, here we go. Let's see the Vim usual mode. We have that key bind in Sublime, but I don't think that's a Vim key bind, is it? I here. No, I had to do block mode, but it's all good. Alright, this is all I know that's right. This is this is so far guys, what I've concluded is right. This part is a little sketchy. We're going to have to figure this part out. So curr.next is equal to previous. This is what I know I think is right. Now, maybe we just need to set like a temp previous or something. So this is going to set that, and maybe just like a temp previous. Cause cause what's going to happen is we need to know that this is the next node that we're doing. So, this is going to be like temp_previous is equal to curr.next. And then we wipe it out by assigning it, and then we need to move on to this node. So we've correctly, so if we go here, okay, this this part is going to correctly set this part. A points at B. So, no, it's not. It's going to point A at A. That's good. And then this is the next one. In B, we just now need to point at B points at A. So we really just need to set A to the previous now. So here, I need to set previous is equal to actually the current. Wait, is this literally all it is? I think this might be all it is. I was overthinking this way too hard. Alright, let me let me think if this is right. So, we're going to set curr.next. All right, let's just let's play it out. Let's play it out. So, okay. We passed in A. Feel free feel free to walk through an example. Yeah, so curr.next is going to be B. And we're setting that equal to to none, okay? And then we're setting previous. Oh, we also have a We need to we need a break statement in here too. Uh, so we're setting then previous equal to A, and then the next iteration, what's going to happened is Oh, we're not setting curr though. We need to set curr. What's your curr be? Curr.next is equal. I think curr is actually just Ooh, do we need to temp next? Actually, curr, yeah, temp temp_curr is equal to curr.next cuz we're wiping out that value. And we need to know what it is. I don't know how people explain this coherently. I've been just saying temp_curr, previous, next_guy. Uh, probably when they figured it out. All right, so we have the next, cuz I didn't want to wipe this out, cuz we're wiping it out here. So I was like, we got to keep the temp value, right? And we're going to say temp_curr and we're setting this. All right, I feel pretty good about this, but I didn't think it through. So let me think it through for a second. Let's do one more run through it. All right, so what's going to happen is All right, so curr.next, that's going to be B. So, this is going to be B. All right, so this I'm setting A to none. And then previous is equal to curr. All right, what's curr right now? Curr's A. So previous is now A. Dude, I just cannot type hashtags today. All right, so that's going to be an A."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I do, I do have an indentation error.
