We were scheduled for an interview around now. Is now still a good time for you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, now is great."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. And since we'll need it for the bulk of the interview, are you next to a computer with internet access?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, I am."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, why don't I go ahead and read you a link that'll get you dropped into the shared editor we're going to be using for the interview. And we'll make sure that our technology works and we can kind of talk about the shape of the interview."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Great, yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Just let me know when you're ready to type in the link."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm ready."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. So it's [reads out link to shared editor]."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Cool, I think I am in."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. I think I see your name at the bottom."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Can you just type something to make sure that I can see it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. Cool."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Do you see that I've typed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sweet. Our technology works. That's good news. So a couple of things before we jump into this interview. The bulk of the interview today is going to be us working through a question in this shared document. I'm sure this is not how you normally write code. I'd be surprising if you normally wrote code talking to a stranger on the phone in a web browser. So a couple of things to try to make that a little more pleasant. First off, please write in whatever language you're most comfortable in. There's syntax highlighting for a lot of popular languages in the upper right corner of your screen, and if you want to write in one that's not out there, that's fine too. So you should feel free to change the language that you prefer."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Cool. Yeah. I'm going to go ahead and use Python 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. Sounds great. Another thing to note is that we're not going to be running your code. So while I'd like you to write real code, code that given a compiler and interpreter, you could make run, if you do the equivalent of missing a semicolon or something like that, that's totally fine. And similarly, I'm not expecting that you have the standard library for your language of choice memorized. If you forget the name of a common library function that exists, just say something and we'll agree on a reasonable API for that function."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure, sounds good."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. And then one last note is just high-level advice for what I'm looking for. We really value clear and correct code here. And so by default, I'd like you to focus on that over writing super efficient code right off the bat. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to make your code fast, and I'm always going to be happy to come back and ask you to make something faster if I'd like you to. Just that by default, I'd like you to focus on clear, readable implementations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So I'm thinking about like code structure, variable names, things like that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Cool, sounds good."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll leave a chunk of time at the end of this for any questions that you've got for me about the interview process or broadly or whatever's on your mind. But otherwise, do you have any questions about what I just described before we get started?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Nope, no questions about that. Sounds great."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. So, let's jump into it. Today, we're going to be dealing with unit conversion. Specifically, I would like to ask you to write a program that can answer unit conversion questions, like how many meters are in an inch, given a big list of conversion facts about units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By way of example, I'm going to paste in some example facts and queries."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh, in the coder pad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, a few things to note. The top has a list of example facts, and the bottom is like a list of example queries that you should be able to answer given those facts. You don't have to do any parsing. So, I'm going to pass the facts to you as string, float, string tuples, and the query is a float, string, string tuple."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Got it. Okay, cool. Yes, makes sense."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Do you have any thoughts on how we might be able to write a function that will be able to answer these queries given those facts?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Let me think a little bit about this. So, what are we going to want to do? We're going to take in all of these facts. Are there kind of like two different steps? Like, should I expect to kind of write a function like, you know, `parse_facts`, something like this, that returns something and then, um, `answer_query`, `query_facts` or something like that? Like, is this a kind of a reasonable thing? Or, would you rather that I kind of parse the facts every query?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think this seems reasonable. What do you think?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I mean, this seems a little nicer. Just so that I can do some pre-processing up front to kind of make `answer_query` simple. I guess I could do that every time, but it seems a little nicer to do all of that work once. So let's think a little about what type of work we want to do here. I guess like, conceptually, we have a couple of different like disjoint graphs. Right? Like, there's the distance graph and the duration graph in this question and or in your example."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What do you mean by graph?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, so like we have, one node in our graph is maybe meter. And we have an edge between meter and foot. And that edge has some annotation indicating that a meter is equal to 3.28 ft. Similar for feet to inches. And then, I mean, maybe we have like one big graph and it's just not fully connected. But we have kind of a separate, series of connections between hours and minutes and minutes and seconds. Right? And I think like this is"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got you. So."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Go ahead."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Go ahead."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I just wanted to confirm, so `parse_facts` is going to take that list of facts and return some sort of like set of graphs or a graph. Is that what you're thinking?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm mostly I'm thinking about like, I think, at a high level, like let's imagine that everything was connected here. Let's imagine that there is no duration. Then like our algorithm is like pick some arbitrary starting point. Maybe we could be clever about what that starting point is. Oh, I sorry. Very clearly, never mind. We pick the node that is equivalent to like meters here because we're answering the two meter question. And then kind of do some type of like BFS or DFS. I don't actually know off the top of my head which would be more appropriate here. In keeping track of the state stored in our edges until we find our inches node. And then apply some conversion based on that state, multiplying like two by the various floats that we've stored at that edges to get 78.72. And I guess like, when doing that, the thing we want to do is, or I guess like if we explore, every node that's connected to meters, and, at no point, do we find inches, which I mean, isn't going to happen, but like this does happen with inches and hours, then we want to return not convertible instead. So I think like actually the state that I want to store, to start out, is going to be something like a dictionary that maps strings, units to some class that represents a node and a graph. And then those nodes in the graph will store like a float, node, tuple, where float is kind of the the way that we want to convert between, the node that we are operating over and the node that we're linking to. And the node that we're linking to is some other unit that we can convert to. So it stores some like, you know, edges, type of, class variable. And then our algorithm is going to be take in, a string, look it up in the dictionary, do, some traversal over the nodes kind of stored in that dictionary, and return an answer or not convertible. I think there is a clever way to keep these graphs that we're building up as small as possible. I have this vague recollection of a thing called Union find, but I don't actually really remember how it works off the top of my head. I would need to go look it up. Is it all right to kind of write the naive thing that I've sketched out here or do you want me to do something a little faster?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Absolutely. Let's go for the naive solution and see how that goes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Cool. And is the thing that I've described like somewhat reasonable, does it make sense, or is it unclear?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think this makes sense to me at a high level. So you want to construct a graph that maps from some units to some other units and you're keeping track of in your graph what that conversion rate is. Does that sound right to you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, let's maybe for the sake of being super explicit, we can make an `Edge` class. [Recruiter starts typing `class Edge:`]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "We can just go for it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[Recruiter continues typing `Edge` and `Node` classes] `class Edge: def __init__(self, multiplier, node): self.multiplier = multiplier; self.node = node`. `class Node: def __init__(self, unit): self.unit = unit; self.edges = []`. `def add_edge(self, multiplier, other_unit_node): self.edges.append((multiplier, other_unit_node))`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, hopefully that makes it a little clearer how I actually want to store this data. And then we're going to, like I said, have some dictionary that tracks individual units to their Node class. So, we can call this whatever, `name_to_node`, a dictionary."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For, and then you said this comes as unit, left unit, multiplier, right unit in facts, is that right? String float string?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yep, that seems right. String float string seems like a reasonable representation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So, what do we want to do? If `left_unit` not in `name_to_node`, `name_to_node[left_unit] = Node(left_unit)`. If `right_unit` not in `name_to_node`, `name_to_node[right_unit] = Node(right_unit)`. Then, `name_to_node[left_unit].add_edge(multiplier, name_to_node[right_unit])`. So, I think this is like somewhat reasonable. Maybe I'll come back for a second pass at that in a second. But we've got this facts dictionary, mapping units to other units. And here multiplier is something like 3.28 or 12, and the thing that I need to remember is to like multiply by it all the time and never divide by it or something like that. I can imagine having a bug there. So now, our query comes in as what? Float times left unit times right unit. So, `starting_unit_amount, from_unit, to_unit = query`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Originally I was thinking like, I am going to have some state that I kind of produce at the end of answer query. And that will be like some set of numbers multiplied by each other. But I was thinking a little more, I was like, oh, it seems a little clearer to instead, have like kind of multiply `starting_amount` in real time. That is, instead of like keeping some list around, every time we kind of traverse across some edge, multiply `starting_amount` by the value in that edge, so you just kind of keep it a running total. But I think what I actually want there depends on like how I want to solve the underlying problem here. And I want to think about that for a second. Okay. What do we want to do? I think like at a given node, we want to enqueue a tuple of like current amount and like unit to check. Yeah, so let's see. This is going to be like, given we are at some node. It has some number of edges. We want to enumerate all of those edges. And, for each of those edges, add some new tuple to a queue, where that tuple contains kind of the amount that we were already keeping track of times the amount encoded in that edge, along with the node that that edge kind of links to. When we do that, we want to be careful to not add nodes that we have seen before, so we're going to want some visited set. And I think also kind of saying all this out loud, we want to do this in kind of a BFS-y way, because the thing that we care about is finding a short path. We don't want to take some convoluted path, because we're like multiplying floats by each other and the more we like multiply floats by each other, the more likely we are to run into like weird float rounding errors."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cool. Yeah, that makes sense to me. So we're trying to write a BFS here and you're now thinking about how to effectively keep track of like the running product of these conversion rates. Does that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and so I think it's like it's a BFS but it's a little funny because I think normally, at least, I don't write that many BFSs, but I'm not normally kind of trying to like keep some other state associated with like each different kind of conceptual unit in the BFS. And but here we are. So, we want like a visited set and that contains only units. And I guess actually, `visited.add(from_unit)` at the start. Or in fact, maybe it's easier to do. How do I want to do this? I think I just need to like write out a couple of lines of code to see what this looks like. So, oh, I didn't do this right. Let's take a step back. We want this node class to have some other edges. Starts out as the empty list. And other node. I guess that's already a node class. So, `self.edges.append(multiplier, other_unit)`. We want to do something like that. Cool. And that way we can refer to edges. So, like for edge. And I guess you probably want to make that an actually you actually use the edge class there, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, totally. Yeah. Huh. Edge equals I sketched these out to make my thoughts clear and then just totally failed to use them. Multiplier, other. And let's just for explicitness, instead of calling this unit, call this node. To make it a little more clear that it is a full on node class. So we're going to grab that. Cool. And then we're going to append edge like that. So we've got this edge in. And let's not actually add from unit to the visited set yet. `to_visit.push(from_unit, starting_amount)`. And then we can do while `not to_visit.empty`: `current_unit, current_amount = to_visit.pop()`. If `current_unit == to_unit`, return `current_amount`. Or print answer equals, but presumably returning that or returning like none is maybe a reasonable API here."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yep, I think that sounds reasonable. Yep, and I think you like swapped your tuple a little, so I think it should be unit, comma, amount in your `to_visit` set. Your `to_visit` queue."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, you're totally right. `current_unit, current_amount`. Thank you for that. Yeah. All right. So, either the unit is the thing that we're looking for, or it's not. And if it's not, first we want to add it to our visited set, so `visited.add(current_unit)`. Then, for edge in `current_unit.edges`, if `edge.node` not in `visited`. If it isn't visited, we don't do anything. Otherwise, `updated_amount = current_amount * edge.multiplier`. And then we want to do `to_visit.push(edge.node, updated_amount)`. And there's something gross here, which is that if we see the same node many times here, before we process that node once, we're going to add it to `to_visit` many times. I'm going to I think so like a gross thing that we can do is also say `visited.add(edge.node)`. That feels gross to me because we're doing that twice. Maybe the right thing to do is to add this up here and special case the first node. That seems reasonable. Yeah. Cool, so we're going to push that in there. And I think that's it if it's in visited, we don't need to do anything. We've added all of the edges, adding more stuff to to visit. And if we get out here, I believe we can just return none. How does this look?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Do you want to walk through an example?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh, yeah, sure. Oh, well, there's one thing that we haven't done, I guess, like a pretty obvious thing is we've never referenced facts. So we probably want to do that. The relevant thing here is that, if `from_unit` not in `name_to_node`, return none, if `to_unit` not in `name_to_node`, return none. Otherwise, `from_node = name_to_node[from_unit]` and `to_node = name_to_node[to_unit]`. And we're going to update a couple of names here. `to_node` conceptually, I think like update all of these as well. Great. Okay. So that was kind of a glaring omission. Otherwise, I think I'm mostly convinced that this `parse_facts` is correct. So I guess I'll focus on `answer_query`. We come in, we get a query. Let's say that it is how many inches are in two meters? [Candidate pastes example above code for easier reference] So, we get in a `starting_amount`, which is two, a `starting_unit`, which is M, and an `ending_unit`, which is inches. Both are in facts because we've seen them referenced up here. We retrieve them from facts. We put `from_node` and `starting_amount` into `to_visit`. So that's meters and two. And we also put meters into the visited set. Then, we pop off meter and two. Meter is not equal to inches. So, this check doesn't fire. We enumerate our edges and our only edge is going to be feet. So we enumerate our edges, we get to feet. We add that to our visited set. We create a new multiplier, which is two times the multiplier associated with that edge, which is 3.28, so that's 6.56, I think. And then add feet and 6.56 or whatever it was that I said. We loop back up here. We're at feet now. We received a foot equals 12 inches fact. So, foot should have. Oh, you know what, one problem I'm going to run into. I'm not sure that I'm running it into it here. But I think one problem that I am going to run into eventually is that this `parse_facts` thing that I'm building up isn't bidirectional and it should be."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. That makes sense. So you're saying like, can you give me an example of what that means?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, so I think that that means up `name_to_node[right_unit].add_edge(1.0 / multiplier, name_to_node[left_unit])`. Naively, this is all we need to do. And so now we should be adding like, when we add a foot is 12 inches, we also add that an inch is 1.0 over 12 ft. And so things should kind of end up working out."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cool. Yeah, that makes sense. So given one particular fact, it actually gives you kind of two conversion rates, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, yeah, exactly. I hadn't thought about that before, but that, seems right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cool, that makes a lot of sense."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, cool. But otherwise, I think that we end up doing the right thing here. Like in the example we were walking through, we were in feet, we were enumerating its edges. We would have gotten to inches. We would have done 6.56 * 12, which I can't do in my head. We would have pushed that into our set, or into our queue. We would have popped that off. Current node would be equal to two node. They're both inches, and so we would return that amount. And I believe that, the kind of reverse case converting inches to meters would now be correct."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cool. All right, thank you so much. I said at the beginning of the interview that I would leave some time for questions, and now is that time."}]}
