{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How are you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks. What about you??"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks for asking. We can get started now, just go ahead and read the problem."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Meaning transformation sequence from word begin word to word end word using a dictionary. Wordless is a sequence of words, begin word, s1, s2, sk, such that every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter. Every si for one greater than I or less than K, as in word list. Okay. Note that begin word does not need to be word list. Okay. Given two words, begin word and end word, the dictionary word list, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from begin word to N word. If no such sequence exists, return zero input hits. And we're cog with this. Okay. So I'm basically trying to transform this, the hit letter by letter, and end up with cog. And I can only change the hit to one of the words in the list. Right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So. Or you can change it to multiple words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I can change multiple times, but, like, I have to go from this to this through this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So go hit, I go hot. Okay. And then the O people get this. See, let's see. Maybe not hot. Maybe it's. Do you know the answer to the examples?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. So for the first one, from hit, the only one, only words that are one letter off are hot, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And then from hot, there are only a couple words that are one letter off, and that is dot and lot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And then from dots and lot, or. I'm not giving. I guess I'm not, like, giving you the direct answer right now. I'm just walking through, like."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The possible path you can go down. Right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, okay. So what I'm seeing is it's kind of like a, a depth first search kind of thing. Right. So if I saw the hit, I look at the list, I only see hot. So I go, I go down the hot and now I have hot. I've changed the word one time, so I'm keeping track of that. Go through the list again. I see dot, dot and dog. Okay, the, then I, then I go down these two words independently. So two, two traversals go dot and then I, maybe I see another word and I send a recursion down there. And then I go from dog, maybe I see a different word and I send a recursion down. So I definitely think that this is a recursion problem and I think it's one that can be optimized by dynamic programming. Because okay, let's say that we, the N word is cog and what's the last word? Maybe we're at log, you know, the last word before we reach the end. And maybe it took us four traversals to get to log. Right. But if I'm from, you know, the other other traversals and I also arrive at log, then I'm going to look at, look at the word log and how many and check how many, how many traversals I need to get to that log. So like for example, if the current traversal takes five steps to get to log, but I already have another path that only takes four words to get to log, then I can just terminate the current path because I know that there's already a shorter way to get to the same word. Right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think you might be over complicating a little. I think there are different, there's a, might be like different ways you can get to your result that doesn't involve something as complicated as dynamic programming. Okay, maybe, maybe like I would suggest like maybe like rereading the lines 11 through 13. Maybe there's some keywords that might hint at like the type of algorithms you might use instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given two words dictionary, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from begin, word and word zero. If no such sequence exists. Okay, I don't have dynamic programming. Maybe like, I guess there has to be some other way that I can get. Keep track of what words I've been to and how many transformations it took to get there. Right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or why don't we draw out, like, the example, the first example. Like, draw all the different possible paths that hit can start with and end up with to get to cog. And then you might find that, like, we don't need to, like, cache all the possible combinations that, to get to a certain word. I think there's a better algorithm that you might have, might be familiar with."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I can get to dot and lot. Dot. Space it out a little. The dot. What do I have thought I can go. I can go back to hot, but it's obviously not going to work. I can go to dog, I can go to lot. But I mean, I see that I've already been to lot, so. Oh, maybe it's just breath research."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why might that work better?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because, you know, I. I see. I see a lot right here. Right. But I've already. If I go level by level like this, that I know that I've already been to lot, I don't need to keep track of, you know, how many traversals because I know that I've traversed three levels, so that's three times. And I see lot again and I know that I've been there, so I know it's unnecessary. Right. I don't need to revisit the same word twice."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How does that differ from, like, dfs though? Like, you're. I guess, like, why is. Why are you opting for BFS first? So dfs, because, like, you both. For both, you keep track of what you visited."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, but I don't have to keep track of how many traversals it took to get there. Well, I guess I have to, though, because, yeah, I think I would still have to keep track of the number of traversals I need to get there because I. I thought that I could infer that information based on how many levels I traversed. Like, if I get to this level, that's level three. So I know it took three steps to get to lot. And so if I see lot again in further traversals, I know that I've already seen it with less steps. That was my thinking, but I would only really be saving the dynamic. Programming array, changing it from a integer array to some sort of like hash set that keeps track of how many words I've seen. Okay, let me see if there's a better way than BFS though. Okay, so I see lot though and then let me continue the example. From dot, I go to. Okay, let's go to lot. Lot I can go to dot, I can go to log. And okay, from dog, I'm gonna go back to thought. I can go to log, but I've already seen log go to. I can go to dot, I can go to high."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "From dog, you can also go to cog."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "From dog, you can go to cog."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh yeah, cog. Okay. Oh, then I've arrived at the solution. So it took 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I'm also like not saying like BFS is wrong. I'm just asking for you, like to justify why you are choosing BFS over D DFS and vice versa."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I think I chose BFS over DFS before was that I can like, based on the level order traversal, I can figure out how many steps it took to get to every word. Whereas dfs, you have to kind of like keep track of that with, with. With an array, dynamic programming array and then like a in step counter. But I think even just going through this manually, I have to definitely keep a visited array or a hash set of some kind because like, like here, right? I. I got a lot, but I've already been a lot. I got a dot, but I've already been to dot. And there's other currencies where I go to the same bird and I definitely don't want to do that because it can basically cause an infinite loop right, where I'm stuck going through the same couple of words in a loop. So let's see if I could do this. Without recursion though. Can I do this without recursion? Can, but that wouldn't really make the algorithm faster anyway. Are you saying that there is a faster way to solve the problem without using BFS or dfs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not saying that there is a faster one. I'm just asking more for the trade off or like I think BFS is fine, it's just that I guess I'll tell you the answer I'm looking for. So I am looking for you to weigh the trade offs between BFS and dfs. Right? So BFS we know is like the shortest will result in the shortest path, right. Whereas DFS does not necessarily do that right off the bat. Right. Because we get explored a path that keeps on going and then finally come across like the shortest path."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because with BFS I can. When I get to cog, I know that, you know, the first time I see it, I know it's probably the shortest, shortest path to get there."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right, exactly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. I thought you meant that recursion or DFS or BFS wasn't the right way and there's some kind of like iterative way you could do it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think I'll do iterative for bfs. And if I'm doing level order traversal where I have to know when each level starts and ends, I have to use the two queue method. And then. Okay, I have to have like a pointer to keep track of how many level traversals I've been to. And then I have to have a. I think I'll do a hash set of strings to keep track of the words that I've already seen. Okay, so my solution is going to look something like this, where I have big use for."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The two cues, they're to keep track of. Like for me to know when the level starts and ends. So like I'll add. For one queue I'll have all of the nodes of the current level, right? So like let's say dot a lot. And when I try to add the children, I'm not going to add them to the same queue. I'm not. I'm going to add them to the second queue so that I know that these are all children and not like, not on the same level as this. So I know that. So I can keep track of how many levels I've been to, you know, and then once this queue is done, is done. I basically. Make the second queue into the first queue and then clear out the second queue so that the second queue can add these child nodes. That's how I keep track of the levels. Right. Okay, so the two queues and then int level, say traversals, number traversals. And this starts at. This starts at one. Wait, if it's possible to get that begin word and N word to be the same word, right? It's possible, yeah. So, okay, I'll make this zero, and it's. If I can go to the beginning word and word in one step, that would be one. So I'll increment this in the BFS loop. I'll just leave it at zero for now. Okay? And then I'm going to have a while loop or no, how would I know when to stop the bfs? I'll say, okay, while the first view isn't, and in the loop I'm going to say equals end word. If it is, then I'll end the I know I found the solution and I'll return it. If not, now add the child. And then if I get to the case where the first queue is empty and then it's time to switch to the next level, then I'll now go U1 equals U2, U2 equals U2. That way I could reset the. Reset the level so that the next level becomes the current level and then the next level becomes a new queue so I can add all the children. And I keep doing this, and if I keep iterating and iterating and then I get to the point where I can no longer go to the next level because I've already traversed through all the words, then I'll return zero. And of course I have to keep track of every word. Like that. Right. Okay, so that, that's going to be the BFS algorithm. But I have to figure out how do I know that a particular word in word list is one letter off from whatever word I have currently. So how do I go from, know from hit that I can go to hot and not dog. Dog Log log. I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to have an character counter, like an integer array of characters. So like hit would be 1, 1H, 1I and then 1T and maybe what's the next one? I think it goes to hot. Hot will have one H, one O and one T. And I can basically check that. Okay, these Hs are equal, keys are equal. The only difference is the O and the I, and the difference is only one. So I know that it's valid."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How do you maintain the ordering? So like, what if I had like and like some random combination?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I would have, I would store the information in an integer array that counts the number of characters. Like. So, for example, if the integer is going to have 26. Oh, by the way, the I can only get lowercase English letters in the words, right? Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's assume that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, then there'll be 26 letters in the Alphabet. Right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And so int zero equals the number, the number of A's. Right. So I could basically go over to the strings and even if they're out of order, they're going to have, if they have the same characters, they're going to show up as the same in the, the character frequency array because they're going to have the same amount of H's, same amount of T's, just different I's and O's. So the order wouldn't mess up the comparison algorithm, in my opinion."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think like, for example, like, dog and God are like two different words. Yeah. Like so, like from dog, there isn't like one letter I can, that I can switch to arrive. Like there isn't one letter I can swap out in dog to get me the word God."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, oh. I think I misread the question because the letters still have to be in the same order. Right. You can't. Yeah, not just that it's one letter off. It has to be. The order has to."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Okay. I think I misunderstood the problem. So I definitely can't do this thing. Okay, well, then I can just iterate through both of the strings and compare the characters at each of the indexes. Right? So D, G. Okay, that's, that's one difference. O and O. Okay, that's good. G and D. Okay, that's different. So the number of differences is two, and that's not valid. So I would know to, to return false for whatever method I decide to write with this. Right? Okay. Yeah, I think that could work. So I'm going to have a method and I'll call it is one R difference. And then I would iterate, iterate through these things. Check every character. If more than one difference, return false. And by the way, begin word and end word, they're, they're guaranteed to be the same length, right? Yeah. Let's assume like, and every word in word list is also the same length."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, let's assume that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So if I, if I get like game and I get N worded games, is that a valid."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, no, we won't have any of that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "All right. Okay, cool. Then I can safely just iterate through both of the strings at the same time because there's the same length. Right. I can just check the indexes because they're the same. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So. Okay. And I need to make sure that only if they're not one letter off, then I'm not going to add it. Okay. So, okay, let's. Let's go over the solution once again. Two queues. Hashtag, number of traversals, bfs. I only add the children that are within one letter off. Okay. Keep track of the words I visited. Add the child. Okay. I think I can. I think I'm going to start coding. Is that okay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, it's fine."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, I'm gonna say Q SC next bubble. So while. Okay, I have to add the first, I have to add the begin word to current level. While level is not empty, get current word from the current level. Then I'm going to check if it's the solution if. Of the source to get to the n word. If the current string is not the solution. The 92 shoulder so I'm going to say okay, I'm going to iterate through the word list and check every single word. If we have not visited this word before and it is a valid valid traversal from the current word, I'll say is valid is valid. Child of the Then I'm going to say next level and I'll say don't forget to or the current word as well. Okay, after I add all the children, I need to check whether or not the current level is empty or completely traverse through. So if current level that is empty, then I need to increase the number of traverse or the step count by one because I'm going to the next level which requires addition an additional step to get there. Then I'll say current level because next level. Next level equals okay and then if I can go through the whole BFS and not find a single solution then I'll turn 0. Now I need to implement the is our child method static string Boolean I'll say string str 1 str 2 this keeps tracks of the number of different characters. So if str1 rs I not equal to str2 char2 number difference if is greater than 1 then now false I'll return true Yep. Okay, let's check the whole thing again. Q Q visited step counter not the first word get the first word record the first word is visited Check for the solution Check all the valid children if they haven't been visited and it's a valid child how to say next level recorded as visited okay then if I go through the current level then I make then move on to the next level and the next level becomes a new queue. Okay. All right, let's try to run it. Okay. Seems like it's not working. Trying to find the issue, though. I'm going to print out the word to see which words I've traversed to. Seems like I'm not adding any valid children. Oh, by the way, can I debug with just print lines in the real and real?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I think that's usually the only way you can do it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think it might be an issue with how I'm checking the children."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "If current chart I do not equal char 2 will return false"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "or I don't think it should be two. Oh I also we are about a minute over but I'll give you like a couple extra minutes finish this up."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh cool. Five."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Five. Okay, why don't we try the I'll try three. Yeah also for your test cases I think in the future I would just have like different test cases instead of just like switching out the variables."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay cool. Should I do the two?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure. You probably get rid of these print statements too at the very end on this slide."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wait, is there I seem to delete this? Why is this line highlighted though?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, SP is not there. Sorry. Okay. You think that you can give me the time and space complexity of this?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, sure. Okay, so I'm bfs. I'm iterating I am iterating through every word at most once so this is. O of N. Okay, but what about checking the valid. Oh, the BFS of O. But for this, this is also O of N. I'm checking every word and for every one of these, I'm checking whether or not it's a valid child. So I'm iterating through the strings once. So that's O of M, where N equals the length of a string."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Longest string."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Length of the longest string."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, well, they would be the same. Right? But yeah, it is the longest string, so."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah, you're right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. So it'll be O of N. That's the bfs. That's to check the lower children. N. Hold on. No worries."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So it's all of N squared times N. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How would your code change if there's no. There was no restriction that, like, the word list has to be the same length? Like, say, what happens if, like, how would your code change if that begin word and N word had the same length? That was a requirement. But there's no requirement that the word list has to be same length of words or same length of letters."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So. Okay, well, first of all, I would know that if these are four, right. If it's. I just do ca, then there's no way, no amount of letter placing can make it match. So I would definitely just automatically ignore any strings that are where length is. Length difference is more than one."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And then."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so what do you mean when you say not the same length? If I have this and I go cre. Let's just say why not? There, there and are. They're off by one letter. But would that. Can they match?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, they can match."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. And so if I, if I go there, that can also match. Right. So first of all, I would. When I'm checking this, I'll check for length."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, you don't have to code it. Just like conceptually, I'm just pseudocoding. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And then for every single one of these, then how would I compare them? Okay, I would. You still have. Okay. Because that. They're not the same length. You can't just like compare them like this. Some. Maybe they're like that or like that. So I have to find a way to handle the different positions if they're not the same length and. Okay, then. Okay, then I would have. I can't have a hash map of the letter to the index because a word can have two of the same letters, so it can't be hashing. It has to be a different data structure that I'm saving the words to. Can I just. Since I know that the difference is only one, can I just say that I have a case where word 1 is shorter than word 2, word 1 is the same length as word 2, and then word word 2 is longer than word 1. I think that that's kind of not. It's kind of hard coding. It point."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I mean, I don't think it's hard coding. It's just like you have. Those are the three cases, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I mean, well, what if it's like, what if you change the question so that now you have like two difference, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh yeah, but like I don't think that's hard coding. I think hard coding is like saying like, oh, if my input is cat and dog automatically return two. Like I, I think that's more hard coding. I think what you're saying is like, yeah, not hard coding. It's just like breaking it down into the different cases, which is perfectly fine."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, but yeah, then, then I would know that it would not hold up. If you change the number of words, it can differ by, you know, it will only work for one word."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh yeah, but like that like your code is not supposed to handle like different length words. Like that's not the problem. That's not the initial problem I gave you. I think I just asked because like usually when you. Sometimes when you finish the interview early, they might ask you like follow up questions and I don't know, just something I figured I'd ask. I don't think that's an actual E code question though. But yeah, yeah, so I guess that was all I had. I go over the feedback. I don't think I much to say again, but I do have a question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So when I'm coding up the solution, I know that I have to make my code, like, easy to understand so that you can just read it and know what I'm doing. But do I have to still talk out loud? Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I was about to say that you should still talk when you're coding, even if it's very simple. When you're writing the main class, I think you're quiet, but you should say, oh, I'm setting up the main class. In Java, you need to run the main function to run the code. Right. I think, like, even simple code, you should. Should still be talking. Ideally, just try to keep talking the entire time. Yeah, let's see."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So should I say what I'm doing or I can't just, like, talk the code out?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, no, no, not like that. Like, don't say like, oh, string current equals. I guess I mean like English terms. Like, I am going to be initializing my array to store this."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Store that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, something like that. And then you can go ahead and type or say it after. You could also type first, say, I created this. I think it's better to do it line by line rather than you could code a chunk of code and it's like a period of silence. I think maybe before you code this, you can go like, oh, I'm going to create a queue to hold my current level. Or you say it after and then write the line of code. Um, yeah, something like that. But yeah, let's see. I have. Anything else? I think I had two other things before. Unless you wanted to say anything else."}, {"role": "user", "content": "No. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think overall, I think again, very good job. I mean, this, this is a hard question as well. So. Yeah, let's see. So I think, like, when you're doing your brainstorm at first, I wouldn't jump straight to like over complicating it. Like, you initially tried like DP and like DFS or dp. So I think it's good to still approach it with a human strategy first."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And then find out like, oh, this looks like BFS or DFS and whatnot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And also I think I've actually seen this problem before, but I forgot. Oh, and then I remember is like, I did some kind of dp. I was just following that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, okay. Yeah, I don't think it's a DP question. I think usually DP and backtrack or So I guess, in short, DP is based off of backtracking. And backtracking is usually if you can't see, like a human approach, you have to try all the different combinations, right? Yeah. And I think for this problem, you're not necessarily trying every single combination. You have, like, some direction, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So I think sometimes drawing it out might help you see that a little better. And I guess I have actually two more things on, so three things in total. So another thing is, when you're writing your test down here, you ideally want to write it as, like, a suite of tests, right? So say you have three tests, right? And you fail your third test and you make a tweak, you still want to make sure that it passes the other two tests, but then because you only have one test here, you kind of erase that input. So by writing all the inputs out at once, you can see if you make a tweak after the third test, you can still see the output of the other two tests before, right? Yeah. You see how it's a little bit more time efficient. It might be a little more costly in time to write out more test cases line by like copy and pasting it. But when you're debugging, it could potentially save you a lot more time. Right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. So I would just make this a string array and 2D array"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "or I guess like what I was. However you do it like I the way I do, I just kind of like, kind of copy and paste it and then make sure like the variables are named differently. So like it'll be like begin word one or like instead of having to begin word, I'll just put like the words or the var values inside."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I mean, you could just reassign it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean. Or like, I guess like copy comment them out or whatever. But ideally you just want them ready and the test ready to go, Right. In case you need to go back and test them again. Yeah. And then I think one other thing. I think for bfs, like a level order traversal, instead of using two cubes, I think you can use a for loop. So like when your current queue is not empty, you just loop through the current size of the queue and anything you add will be automatically on the next level."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How would I know how many to leave? Well, I can save it beforehand."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me share my screen. It's in Python, but maybe you'll get the idea too. So, so I have my while loop. This is so long. The queue is not empty and I have a while loop of my queue. Right, so how does this work? Right, So I have my queue. Say I have 1, 2 and 3, and the next choice I want to add are 4, 5 and 6. Right. So my current length is this. Right? So I'll pop off one, add four. Or let's say like the Q children are like this, right? There's like a direct relationship."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So I would pop off 1, let me switch the color and then add 4, pop off 2, add 5. Sorry if it's a little messy, pop off 3 and add 6. But because of this guard, right, of this for loop, I'm not going to visit 4 and 5 and 6 next. Right. Because of the for loop. And then once the for loop finishes, then I'll switch over. This is my next loop in the level."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wait, you can just have an array as a Q in Python, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's an array list, if I remember correctly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I think the main thing I'm getting at is, like, there's a for loop. Over the size of the current level. Current size of the queue and that. I mean, I think your way is fine too. I just think there's. I guess like they're usually the 4 level. BFS is like using a for loop inside the while loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, yeah. So because that way you only have one queue. But I mean, they technically would store."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, both still work. But like, I'm just like, this is a nitpicky thing. I think it's just like it's up to you how you code it. Whatever makes sense in your head. But I think maybe the for loop is a little bit quicker because I don't know, I think it's subjective. Right. If it makes sense in your head, by all means, keep doing it. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I got this trick from a different legal problem. I think it's the level order traversal vehicle problem. I think it's like a tree."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right. Level order and you put the result. Yeah, I think either works. Yeah. I don't think, like, don't take that as like a critique. I think in my head that just comes to me a little quicker, I think. I'm sure this way comes to you quicker. Yeah. But that's all I have. I think everything else you did perfectly. I like how you like call it out. Like the like if word list the word. Sorry. The length of the words in wordless had to be the same. And then like, things like that. I think those are all, like good cases to call out. I think I would add that maybe some additional questions edge cases you can always ask are about the inputs. Would these ever be null? Would wordless ever be null? Stuff like that. But I think your code handles it right. But I think it's like if these are null, you can return pretty automatically. Right. Without the initial line."}, {"role": "user", "content": "But other than that, I think."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Go ahead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is it okay to cache these input exceptions as I code cache the right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Wait, sorry, say that again."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Like, if I don't catch all the input exceptions in the initial brainstorming phase and I cache them without coding, is that. Does that affect anything? Is that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I mean, I don't think it affects anything. Like, I think the main thing in the beginning is that you're trying to catch like edge cases that could potentially change your entire approach. Yeah, I guess like small edge cases like, oh, is it input this and that, maybe they might change your entire approach, but most of the time they won't. But I think it's fine to catch them later on. It's just like. However is most time efficient for you right? Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, but I think that's all I have with you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. I wish you the best of luck with your career and wherever it may take you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Thanks for the time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, no problem. Best of luck! You can quit the interview when you're ready."}]}
