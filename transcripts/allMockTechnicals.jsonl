In other words, Strobogrammatic Number appears the same right-side up and upside down.\n\n0 after 180° rotation : (0 → 0)\n1 after 180° rotation : (1 → 1)\n8 after 180° rotation : (8 → 8)\n6 after 180° rotation : (6 → 9)\n9 after 180° rotation : (9 → 6)\n\n\nExamples :\n\nInput : n = 2\nOutput : 88  11  96  69\n\n\nInput : n = 4\nOutput : 8008 1001 9006 6009 8888 1881 9886 6889 8118 1111\n        9116 6119 8968 1961 9966 6969 8698 1691 9696 6699\n\nINTUITION:\nTo determine if a number is strobogrammatic, we can map each digit to its corresponding digit when flipped 180 degrees. We initialize a list, d, where the index corresponds to a digit and the value at that index corresponds to what the digit would look like after being flipped 180 degrees. In the list d, a value of -1 means the digit does not form a valid number when flipped (these are the numbers that cannot contribute to a strobogrammatic number).\n\nA strobogrammatic number should be symmetrical around its center. Therefore, we only need to compare the first half of the string to the second half. We set up two pointers, i starting at the beginning of the string and j at the end, and move them towards the center. At each step we:\n\nConvert the digits at indices i and j to integers a and b.\nCheck whether the strobogrammatic counterpart of a is equal to b. If it's not, we immediately return false since the number is not strobogrammatic.\nMove the pointers inward, i going up and j going down.\nIf we successfully traverse the string without mismatches, then the number is strobogrammatic and we return true.\n\nThe solution is elegant because it only requires a single pass, giving us an efficient way to solve the problem with O(n) complexity, where n is the length of the string num.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hey, what's up?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hey, how are you doing?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good, good. All right. So is this your first mock interview? Right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes. First one."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Have you done a mock technical interview before?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so Basically this is 45 minutes, 40 minutes of which we'll be coding, and then 5 minutes, I'll give you feedback at the end. 40 minutes is a little shorter than usual for, like, a normal coding interview. Usually they're 45 minutes to 60 minutes, but again, this is just to make sure you have the general procedure down of how to approach technical interview. Yeah. So why don't you read the problem description on your left. You can write your solution in the code editor on the right. I can see the code that you write in real time. Do you have a preferred programming language?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, it's Java."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The question is already there, so you can get started. The timer is already on."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Let's read the question. Given a string num, which appears, which represents an integer turn. True. If num is a strobe. Strobo gram. Strobo grammatic number. Strobo grammatic number is a number that looks the Same when rotated 180 degrees. Looked at upside down. Example 669. You rotate it. Okay. Also 69, 8, 9, 6 2. False. Okay, so when I'm first thinking about this problem is that there are special numbers between 1 and 9 that can achieve this special property of being strobo grammatic. Right. So like 6 or 9, when you flip it upside down, they 6 flip upside down looks like 9, and 9 flip off. Like down looks like 6. 8 is the same whether you flip it or not. And the two, you can't really flip it because if you flip it, it doesn't look like any number. So let me think of whether or not there's other numbers that have this property. So can one be flipped upside down?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. Let's say one is just like the vertical. Like a vertical line."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. It's. So it's not like the one with the."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's just like this actually line."}, {"role": "user", "content": "We have 1, 2. Not valid. 3. No, because it would look like an e."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "No. 3, 4. Probably not. 5. 5. Nope. Because it looks like an S. 6. And then we have 7. Nope. 8. And then 9. Yep. And then 0. Yes. Okay, nice. Okay, so we have 1. Sorry. 0, 1, 6, 8, 9. And I'm noticing that some of these numbers, when you flip them upside down, they stay the same. So 018. When you flip them upside down, they stay 018. But if you flip 6, it becomes 9. If you flip 9, it becomes 6. So we need to be aware of how these numbers look when they flip upside down, specifically, being careful with the sixes and the nines. Because If I think 69 works. Because when you flip it upside down, the 9. Because you read it backwards. Right. If you flip it upside down."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, Sorry."}, {"role": "user", "content": "When you flip. Flip it, is it like this or is it like this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The first way."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The first way. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. So 180 degrees."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So as if, like, as if you flipped your monitor around and, like, was reading it that way. Yeah, yeah. So I."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So technically, I will be reading 96, but because it's flipped upside down, it becomes 69. Is that correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Are you saying 96 as a different example?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No, for the first number, if I flip it, I will be reading. Technically I'll be reading the nine first and then the."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because it's flipped, it becomes 69."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And by the way, can I get negative numbers in this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's say no for the prompt."}, {"role": "user", "content": "All right, so what I need to be careful of, if I have 66 as an another example and I flip it upside down, that it wouldn't actually be a valid answer because it would turn to 99. Right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Correct."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So. And I'm getting the input as a string, not as an integer. Okay. So what I think I'm going to do is I'm going to iterate through the string once and check every single character and determine whether or not it will be valid if it's rotated 180 degrees. So first of all, I would check if. If it's a 0, 1, 6, 8, 9, if it's like a 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, then I would assume that the input is automatically false because there's no way that any of those numbers turned upside down could be a valid number. Is that correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, that's correct."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. And then I would need to consider that. Okay, it should also be a. Palindrome, technically, if it's flipped upside down because the orders of every number are reversed, right? So, for example, it would need to be something like 01, 6, 1 0, I flip this upside down. Or no, that wouldn't be valid because the 6 becomes a 9, then it becomes a different number, and then so this would be valid. 0, 1, 8, 1, 0. Okay, so basically what I need to do is maybe what I could do is I could iterate through the string once, the input string once, and create the string that. With the string that would be flipped 180 degrees, if you look at it that way. So, like, If I have 110810 as the input, I would go ahead and flip the number to be 1 8, 10 and then compare the two strings after to check whether or not they are the same string. If they are the same, then that means I can. It's a valid number. Like, for example, if I have six here, then flip it upside down and become nine. Then these two numbers wouldn't be the same, and so it's not valid. Okay, but what if I have, say, 6, 6, 9, 9? Then this, this number would not be valid because if you flip it, then the six would become nines and it becomes a different number. Is that a correct assumption?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I guess. One question. Like, what about. Like, what about for the example, 69? Like, I understand that you're creating, like, a new output, right? Like, how can you elaborate on that final part when you're comparing the two numbers that you create?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so I would convert. I would convert every single one of these numbers to their equivalent if they're flipped 180 degrees, because, okay, so six, when you flip it upside down, becomes nine. Yeah, we flip it upside down becomes six. Okay? Oh, then that. This input is true. But if I compare them like this, it would be false. So this approach is not valid. Okay, let me think about why it's not valid. Because. Okay. Because if you have. Because sixes and nines become different numbers when you. Yeah. Okay. So I guess what I'm trying to compare is. Okay, maybe if I compare. So, like, going back to this one, if I go over and compare the two numbers, I start with the first digit and compare it to the last digit of this one. And if I apply that thinking to the first example, I would compare the six to the last digit, which is also six, and I'll compare nine to the first digit. So, like, one will be going forward, one will be going backwards. Nothing. That would be a better solution. Correct."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So what I'm understanding is you're mapping things to their rotation and then checking the newly created string backwards and comparing that to the original."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That makes sense to me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This. This would require O N space since I'm creating another string and it would run in, sorry, linear time because I'm iterating the string twice. Once to convert, once to check."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Makes sense to me."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Do you think I should implement the solution right now, or do you want me to come up with a solution with better memory complexity or maybe even time complexity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think that sounds optimal to me. Why don't we go ahead and start coding?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So we have. And I can name the method anything."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, whatever you think is the best fit."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So the first thing I need to do is I need to create a map of these numbers and. Well, maybe I don't. Perhaps I could just use IF statements to check. Would you like me to have a map or do you want me to just use IF statements to convert the numbers to their flipped equivalent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think you should use a map. I think that's cleaner."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so let's say hash. Now, inverse equals new. This is going to store invalid numbers that can be flipped. And. Okay. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to populate the map. Populate, map. And then after I populate the map, I would iterate or no. First of all, I would create a string that would be the flipped equivalent of the first string. And then I would iterate through the original string and create the flip string one character at a time. Okay. Then after I create the flipped string, I would need to compare to see whether or not the two strings are valid. And I need to use an approach where I compare the first string to the last second string to the second last. Like that. So I would use another. For loop. For loop and check."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, for. Sorry to interrupt. For line 30 and 31. Are those the same steps or are those two different steps?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is to initialize them. The variable."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, I see. I see. My bad. Sorry."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I didn't make it clear. For a loop to check the flip string to see if it is equal to the input. They're in reverse order. Okay. And then I. I just return true or false from here. Return results. How much time do I have left?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "About like 20 minutes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, cool. Okay, let's populate them. Dot put as I just manually put them. The 0. 0 goes to 0 because 0 flip upside down is also 0. Next is 1. 1 flipped upside down is also 1. 6 flip upside down is 9. 8 flipped upside down is 8. And 9 flipped upside down is 6. 0, 1, 6, 8, 9. Okay, good. Now let's create the flip screen flip. Because I should use a string because it's faster equals use builder. Okay. Because I'll be continuously adding characters to the flip string. And so if I use a string, then I will need to recreate the string every single time I put a new character. And so I think a string builder will be more efficient. So let's iterate through the original string. 4. I can say RC for S. So I'm basically getting every single character in the string S, which is the input. And so for each character I would say char flip flip. Char is equal to number flips C. This is basically getting the flip revival of the current top. For example, six goes to. Okay, next we need to add the flipped character to the string builder to build the flip string. So let's say flipped and it is the flipped chart index. Yeah, I'm not too sure about the syntax here. Maybe I'll go back to check the documentation after I completed the solution. Is that okay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, you can do it now too, if you want. Whichever works for you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, I think I'll come back to this. I think this is probably correct, but. Okay. After we created the flip string, so we have the original string and then we have the flip string, we need to compare the two from reverse order. So we will have a for loop for I equals 0i less than s dot length while I press plus. So again we need to compare the first character to the last second to the second last. So we need to say if statement if. If the original strings character at index I is not equals to flip. Oh, sorry, I should. Before I do that, let's say equals flip."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, I think you have a typo on 44. I think it's flipped instead of slipped other side of the equal sign. So if."}, {"role": "user", "content": "All right, flip flex R x I minus S dot length. Let's see if that's correct. No, it should be S dot length minus I is I. Check this. So let's say I'm checking the first string where I 0 and then I would be checking the length. Like let's take this example. Length is 5. So 5 minus 0 is at index 501234. I think I will go out of bounds on that one. So yeah. What about checking the last character of the original string? Let's say I is equal to 4 and I'll be checking. Index1 and that's not correct. So I need to add a minus one here. Okay, so if they're not equal, then that means the flip number is different. And so we should immediately return false in this situation. So we do that for every single character and if the for loop manages to iterate, finish iterating without triggering this condition, and that means the strings must be equals. So in that case I'll return true. Let me look over this code one more time. I think I missed something here where I forgot to check whether or not it's the current character is one of these numbers. So I would say the way I would check is if number get c is null. Here we check for valid numbers. So let's say we get like a two, right? A two. If we try to get the number two in hashmap, it's going to return null because there's no mapping the two. And so if we get an invalid number, then we should immediately return false because there's no way that a invalid number can have a valid flip solution. So I think I forgot that in my first time implementing this. So we check for invalid numbers, get the flip version, and then we append the flipped char equivalent to the string builder. Then after that we go over the string, we check the first and the last. If they're not equal, then the string is not valid. Then return false. Also return true. Okay, so let me check the Java documentation for the syntax builder builder. Append. I'm doing a char and an integer char, char, char. I guess I could just append with the chart and then it will automatically go to the last index. So I assumed that should just be this. Okay, I believe this implementation is looks good to me. Should I manually run test cases or do I click run?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think since we can't we have the run feature available. Let's like run the test cases."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Yeah, let's do. Let's say solve. Let's use an example. Let's use 69. Okay. Click run."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, your input is a string."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Ah, sorry, I made a mistake here. Should be s proper counts chocs yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or your input at line 59 should be a string."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Line 59. What's that?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So you're passing in an integer 69 whereas the input is a string."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Not find simple hashmap I need to import it. See, I believe it's just Java input. Java util hashmap Strange. Is it because of an original group?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it let me try it as well. Something to do with your import since there's no semicolon. Or like your import was correct originally. It just needs a semicolon Afterwards. I ran it on my side."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Did it work on your side?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. Or you need a semicolon here. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Thank you. And then maybe try again. Is there any way to abort my run?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You could refresh the page. It should still keep your code. Yeah. Oh, sorry."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It. Let's do this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not sure why it takes so long to run either. It runs pretty instantly on my end. I can try running it for you if you want. This cannot find our load Main class main Caused by Java LAN Class not found exception main I think you need to capitalize main. Yeah. At least that's what the error output I'm getting is. Let me try again. Although I do think sharepad might be down."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not sure because I'm not seeing like, your cursor anymore or anything like that, even though we're technically collaborating. But yeah, I think overall it looks correct to me. If you want, we can dry run instead, just so that you're able to practice dry running or running your code. It's up to you. I think I already like the code looks correct to me. If you want, we can jump straight to feedback."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Let's go to feedback."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. And then in future interviews, we can practice dry run and going through the run just because today is not working for some reason. Yeah. But also, depending on the type of interview you're doing, sometimes you're able to do a dry run. Sometimes you're only allowed to do like a, like, running through the ide. But we can practice both in our, like, later interviews. But yeah, let me go into feedback. I think overall, I think this is a very strong performance. I think it's a very strong baseline. Like, you can only go up from here. See, where's my. There it is. Okay. Have you seen this rubric before?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so this is basically like the steps you should have included in every single technical interview that you do. Yeah. So I also took some notes on my iPad, I guess, before I start. I think one note that. Or one thing that's just like a small thing. I think you should keep track of your own time as well. Like, Yes, I can also, I can answer, like, and give you, like, how much time you have left. But I think it's also good to keep track of time on your own end just to. So that in case the problem is tricky, you can also manage like, oh, I should speed up. Or not, like. Okay, yeah, just. Just a suggestion."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What about for in persons?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like, in person, like, when you're. Oh, like, if you shut up."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In person for interview, do they have a clock or."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've not done an in person interview. Personally, I think they're quite rare. But I think, like, you could set a stopwatch or whatever works for you, like, or like wear a watch or something. I think it's just so that you know to manage your own time. Because, like, ideally in like an interview, right, you want to get through everything. You want to get through your brainstorm coding it out and then testing your code. Right. Yeah. So, yeah, I'll start with this. Any other questions about the time, though?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. But I think that's only a very small thing. I think it's just for. If the problem's trickier. But I think you are pretty strong at this based on what you'veshown today. Understand the problem. I think you were quick to read the problem. Understand the problem. And like, I liked how you walked through, walked through an example to show that you are on the same page. And personally I like calling out edge cases right after understanding problem, which is exactly what you did. You asked if it was negative, things like that. I think another question you could ask about inputs is not only about like negative numbers or I think other things you can ask like, oh, will it be empty? Or like if I think for this example, right, Will it ever like be like some too large of a value or something like that? Anything like that. But I think overall this is pretty strong solution brainstorming. I think your thought process was very well thought out and you explain your thoughts very well. So I think you were not ever silent, which is a good thing, right? You want to start talking right away just so that if you struggle, the interviewer can jump in and if the interviewer has any input, they can go ahead and say it rather than waiting on you to speak. So good job on this coding implementation. I think you're pretty quick. Again, it's also perfectly fine to look things up. Just ask the interviewer. Also, I think it's important that you look up documentation rather than put in ChatGPT or something like that. It shows that you are able to read technical writing, which is something that you will do in the workplace. I think coding overall, I think it's very clean. I would say that some variables could be renamed better. Like for example, like s string S. Like your input is like a num and whatnot. But that's a small thing, right? And I think the comments might be a little overkill. I think it's like, for these, I think at first, before you started coding, right, you only wrote the function and when you started coding, you were like writing out your steps in the comments. I think that's fine. It helps you remind yourself what to do, right? But I think like, I think like steps like these, like these comments here are a little overkill. I think like the code already, the code already shows that you're doing this. Like, I think one thing that I follow is like good production code, like, good code does not need comments. Like if your variables are named correctly and like your variables themselves should kind of hint at like what it's doing, right? If they're named. Good enough. So I think like the comments in the beginning, the outline steps are probably sufficient. Unless your code is like pretty intricate. Then you can add a comment here and there. But I don't think we need a comment for every line. I think any, like coder should kind of follow your logic. And like, also you're talking aloud. Like, when you're writing the. Like when you're writing the comment, you're kind of like repeating what you just said aloud, which is. Isn't really necessary. If there's a lot more code to write, you would be using a lot of time writing comments, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So that's just my suggestion. I think it's good to write comments, but I think maybe we can tone it down a little. I think this is pretty strong as well. You broke down the. Problem you caught out edge cases. I think the, the example test case that I gave are pretty simple, so I think you came up with extra ones. That's good communication. Like I already touched earlier, you were explain your thoughts throughout the entire interview, which is good time and space. I actually call this out in the beginning and then you asked if. Oh, actually one thing about this. So I remember like when, when you mentioned time and space complexity, you said it correctly. And then when you ask to code, you ask like, oh, should I start coding or is there a more optimal solution? I think there's a better way to rephrase that. I think more so the latter part of that question, like, yes, you are allowed to code, but I think if it is the optimal solution, I think you should instead flip the question around so that it's worded more. So like, I believe that this is the optimal solution because of this and that, like you see how like that type of question, it shows that you're more confident and you are also providing like a justification. I think adding your line of reasoning shows that you know what you're thinking and doing. Right? Like, yeah, in this technical interview you should be in the driver's seat. So you're calling the shots, handling the trade offs and making decisions. And I think phrasing the question in that manner shows and emphasizes those like, traits. Right? Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And then this, I think there wasn't, I don't think there's anything to optimize on the code. But when you finish coding, you should always revisit this. Like take a moment, like 30 seconds just to take a glance over. In addition to like looking for syntax errors and whatnot. I think like I mentioned earlier, handling education, testing, I think you're calling this out when you're brainstorming, which is good. Right. You want to call out the edge cases early on in case it shapes or breaks your code. Right. You don't want to find out later in the code and it shapes like breaks your entire thought process. But I also think we can work on the syntax errors. I think there are a lot of syntax errors and I think that just comes in practice. And I think also because you're using Java, I personally use Python just because it's a lot simpler. But to each their own. Right? If you're faster with Java, then by all means stick with it. Yeah. And I think, like, I'm not sure, I guess, like I'm not too familiar with Java. So like I, I can't help you really with like whatever this message."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, but like writing using a sharepad, I think, like."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I. I think it should be like any IDE though. I don't. Maybe, maybe just because Shared pads down today, but you can give it a try, like another time. But it should be like any other ide, like programmers or whatever. Let's just try here. Let's see if this works."}, {"role": "user", "content": "There's a. Where's Java? There's a typo on the main issue. I think it's lowercase main."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Yeah. This probably just sharepath then. But I think we. We did have, like, a lot of syntax errors, which.

And, yeah, I think, like, it's fine to forget things, but, like, don't forget that approach. And I think with practice, right, you won't get as, like, stressed or anything like that during, like, a technical or anything. So I think with practice, you would recall those things that you had came up with as a human in your human thought process. Yeah. But I think overall, I think this is a very strong baseline.

Initially, all balls are uncolored. For every query in queries that is of the form [x, y], you mark ball x with the color y. After each query, you need to find the number of colors among the balls.\n\nReturn an array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of colors after ith query.\n\nNote that when answering a query, lack of a color will not be considered as a color.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: limit = 4, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[1,3],[3,4]]\n\nOutput: [1,2,2,3]\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n\nAfter query 0, ball 1 has color 4.\nAfter query 1, ball 1 has color 4, and ball 2 has color 5.\nAfter query 2, ball 1 has color 3, and ball 2 has color 5.\nAfter query 3, ball 1 has color 3, ball 2 has color 5, and ball 3 has color 4.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: limit = 4, queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,2],[3,4],[4,5]]\n\nOutput: [1,2,2,3,4]\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n\nAfter query 0, ball 0 has color 1.\nAfter query 1, ball 0 has color 1, and ball 1 has color 2.\nAfter query 2, ball 0 has color 1, and balls 1 and 2 have color 2.\nAfter query 3, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, and ball 3 has color 4.\nAfter query 4, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, ball 3 has color 4, and ball 4 has color 5.\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= limit <= 109\n1 <= n == queries.length <= 105\nqueries[i].length == 2\n0 <= queries[i][0] <= limit\n1 <= queries[i][1] <= 109\n\nSOLUTION GUIDE:\nOverview\nOur task is to return an array listing the number of distinct colors after each query. Note that in this case, distinct means the number of total colors. It does not mean that the color only appears one time.\n\nLet's look at an example of a potential set of queries:\n\nCurrent\n\nIn this problem, two main scenarios can occur at each query:\n\nUncolored Ball - adding a color to a ball that did not already have a color\nColored Ball - adding a color to an already colored ball, replacing the previous color on the ball with the new color\nApproach 1: Hashmap and Array (MLE)\nIntuition\nWhen approaching this problem, the main challenge is efficiently tracking and updating the colors of the balls after each query.\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll need to track both the number of times each color appears, and the number of distinct colors.\n\nLet's consider the two different scenarios that occur when a query is applied to a ball. If the ball is:\n\nUncolored: the count of the newly assigned color is increased.\nColored: the count of the new color is increased and the count of the previously assigned color decreases.\nWhether or not the number of distinct colors is impacted will depend on the total number of balls of that color already present.\n\nA hashmap can be used for this purpose since it efficiently associates counts with specific colors.\n\nWe also need to track the current color of each ball because the problem involves overwriting existing colors. A straightforward solution is to use an array to store the color of each ball, where the index represents the ball and the value at that index represents the current color of the ball.\n\nWith these data structures in place, we can now proceed to process the queries. For each query, we update the color of the ball and adjust the count of distinct colors accordingly. As we process each query, we maintain the color count and track the balls' colors.\n\nHowever, this solution ultimately fails due to exceeding the memory limit allowed for this problem.\n\nAlgorithm\nInitialize:\nan integer n, equal to the length of queries.\nan array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of distinct colors after the ith query.\nan array ballArray, which stores the distinct ball labels found when traversing queries and the current colors associated with them.\nA hash map colorMap, which stores the number of distinct colors after processing the current query.\nIterate from index 0 to n - 1 to traverse the queries. For each query, query[i]:\nInitialize:\nan integer ball equal to query[i][0], denoting the current ball that will be colored.\nan integer color equal to query[i][1], denoting the color that the ball will be colored.\nIf ballArray[ball] is not 0, meaning the ball is already colored:\nCheck the existing color of ball, which will be labeled prevColor.\nDecrement the count of prevColor in colorMap.\nIf the count becomes 0, remove prevColor from colorMap.\nUpdate ballArray[ball] to color.\nIncrease the count of color in colorMap by one.\nSet result[i] to the size of colorMap.\nReturn the result array.\nImplementation\n\nComplexity Analysis\nLet n be the number of queries and m be the limit.\n\nTime Complexity: O(n)\n\nThe algorithm iterates through each query exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each query.\n\nSpecifically, for each query, it checks and updates the ballArray and colorMap, both of which are O(1) operations due to the use of a hash map (colorMap) and an array (ballArray).\n\nTherefore, the overall time complexity is linear in the number of queries, O(n).\n\nNote: The operations on the colorMap (such as get, put, and remove) are considered O(1) on average due to the nature of hash maps.\n\nSpace Complexity: O(m+n)\n\nThe space complexity is determined by the ballArray and the colorMap. The ballArray has a size of m+1 (since it stores the color of each ball up to the limit m), and the colorMap can store up to n distinct colors in the worst case (if all queries introduce a new color). Therefore, the space complexity is O(m+n).\n\nNote: The result array also contributes O(n) space, but since it is part of the output, it is typically not counted in the auxiliary space complexity. However, if we include it, the space complexity remains O(m+n).\n\nApproach 2: Two Hash Maps\nIntuition\nThe main challenge from the previous solution is identifying and addressing areas where large amounts of memory are used.\n\nA significant portion of our memory usage comes from the array of size limit + 1. When we look at the constraints, we can see that the value of limit can be extremely large, with the range 1 <= limit <= 10^9. Contrarily, the queries only range from 1 <= n <= 10^5, where n is the length of queries. As we navigate through the queries, we can see that not all of the ball labels are guaranteed to be accessed by the queries, leading to unnecessary memory usage.\n\nWe can improve our storage efficiency by eliminating wasted space. Here, we need to choose a data structure that only allocates space as needed. Similar to how the colors are stored, we can utilize a hash map to store only the necessary labels accessed by the queries. By doing so, we can optimize the space complexity and prevent memory overuse.\n\nAfter making this adjustment, we can apply the same logic and procedure as the previous solution. With this space optimization, we can process and track the results from the queries while staying within the memory limit.\n\nAlgorithm\nInitialize:\nan integer n, equal to the length of queries.\nan array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of distinct colors after the ith query.\ntwo hash maps:\ncolorMap, which stores the number of distinct colors after processing current query.\nballMap, which stores the distinct ball labels found when traversing queries and the current colors associated with them.\nIterate from index 0 to n-1 to traverse the queries. For each query, query[i]:\nInitialize:\nan integer ball equal to query[i][0], denoting the current ball that will be colored.\nan integer color equal to query[i][1], denoting the color that the ball will be colored.\nIf ball already exists in ballMap, meaning it is already colored:\nCheck the existing color of ball, which will be labeled prevColor.\nDecrement the count of prevColor in colorMap.\nIf the count becomes 0, remove prevColor from colorMap.\nUpdate ballMap[ball] to color.\nIncrease the count of color in colorMap by one.\nSet result[i] to the current size of colorMap.\nReturn the result array.\nImplementation\n\nComplexity Analysis\nLet n be the size of queries.\n\nTime Complexity: O(n)\n\nThe algorithm iterates through each query exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each query.\n\nSpecifically, for each query, it checks and updates the ballMap and colorMap, both of which are O(1) operations on average due to the use of hash maps.\n\nTherefore, the overall time complexity is linear in the number of queries, O(n).\n\nNote: The operations on the ballMap and colorMap (such as get, put, and remove) are considered O(1) on average due to the nature of hash maps.\n\nSpace Complexity: O(n)\n\nThe space complexity is determined by the ballMap and the colorMap.\n\nIn the worst case, ballMap can store up to n distinct colors (if all queries introduce a new ball label), and the colorMap can store up to n distinct colors (if all queries introduce a new color). Therefore, the space complexity is O(2n), which simplifies to O(n).\n\nNote: The result array also contributes O(n) space, but since it is part of the output, it is typically not counted in the auxiliary space complexity. However, if we include it, the space complexity remains O(n).\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hey. How are you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good.

You're given an integer limits and the 2D array queries of size N by 2. There are number plus 1 balls with distinct labels in each label in the range 0, the limit. Initially, the balls are uncolored.

But there are limit plus one balls. Okay. With distinct labels in the range of zero limit. Okay, so from what I understand, let's say, for example, one, there are five balls. And so if I go over each of the queries, it's going to be, I'm going to color ball 12 to the color 4, and then the ball 2 to the color 5, ball 1 to the color 3, ball 3 to the color 4. Is that correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yep, it's correct."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. And so I'm trying to return an array of the number of distinct colors. And after each query. Okay, I think I understand the question now. Okay, so basically, basically I need to keep track of all of the elements in the array which are balls, and I need to keep track of how many distinct values there are inside of the array. Can. Does an uncolored ball count as a distinct color?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No. Like if you walk through the example for the first one. Like, since we have. After the first query, we've only colored one ball. Yeah, we only consider that. Whereas the other four balls are unaccounted for. Right. Because they're originally uncolored."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so what I'm thinking of right away is I can probably keep track of the number of distinct colors with a hash set. So let's say I have four, then I will add. So I would have a hash set of four in there initially, and then after that I'd have five and then three. Okay, but three, I'm recoloring the ball one to three, so that means the four gets removed. And so I. So it. There are still two colored balls. And then I go, ball three equals color four. So I think, I think instead of a hash set, I need to use a hash map because I also need to keep track of which ball is colored, what is color to what color. So what I'm thinking is I would have a hash map where the key is equal to the. Would it be the color or the ball index? It would probably be the. I think it would be the ball. Because, yes, because I can only have so many balls, but I can have as many colors as I want. So the hash set, sorry, hashmap of ball index to bullet. And then for every query, I would first check the index of the ball to see if, if that ball has already been colored because I've kept track of it with the hash map. And if it has been colored, I would remove the entry with that ball index and then replace it with the new. With the new color of the same ball. So what that will look like. And the first example is I would have. So ball one is colored to four. And then I would have ball two is color to five. And then I would. So the third query involves the first ball again. So I would check is the first ball colored? And which, which it is. So I will remove the entry with the 14 and then replace it with 1 3. Because if you color the same ball twice, the ball becomes the. The last color that you color with. Right? Okay, so then I have 2, 5, 1, 3, and then I'm going to have 3, 4, because ball three hasn't been colored. So I've reached the end of the queries and so far there are three entries in the hash map, which means that I have three distinct colors in the. In the list. Okay, But I also need to keep track of not just the duplicate balls, but duplicate colors, because if I have something like 3, 5. Oops, 3, 5. That would only mean that I have two distinct colors, because 2 is color 5 and 3 is color 5. So I also need to keep track of duplicate colors. What I could do is that I could keep track of the colors in the hash hash sets. So I would have a hash map and then a hash set. The hash map keeps track of the ball and the color, and the hash set keeps track of all the colors in the entire ball group. That worked though. Okay. So if I have a hash set to keep track of the colors, then the number of distinct distinct colors in the ball group would be. Would it be the length of the hash map or the length of the hash set? It would be the length of the hash set. Okay. Okay. So now that I have a hash map and a hash set, I need to have a way to keep track of both the ball and the color and then have a way to remove the distinct colors if a ball ever gets recolored. So let's say I have the hash set is 1, 4, 2, 5. And then I get. Sorry, the hash map would be 1425. And then the hash set would be just 4 and the 5. And so let's say I get a 1, 3, 3. Then I would need to recolor ball one, right? And so I would look at the index one because ball one's getting recolored. And I would look at what color it is. I would say four. In this case, I would need to remove four from the hash set and then add three. It has sets. Okay, but that still wouldn't work because it's possible that multiple balls have the same color. How could I keep track of the number of balls that are colored the same color? Let's think about this. Would I need to have a hash map of a color, a color to a list? So I will have a hash map of the color list of white color. It'd be like that. So what I would have, if I still come back to the example, one is I would have. I would have color four and then one there. And then I would have color five, then the ball two. Then when I reach one, three, I would have. The color three and the ball. Whoops. Color. Sorry, ball one. But if I do it like this, then I don't have access to the balls. The ball index has a key in the map, so I don't know whether or not a ball has been recolored. Okay, well, it's kind of tricky because I need to keep track of what balls map to what color and what colors are mapped to what ball. So does that mean that no matter what, I have to have two data structures to keep track of everything?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Is that a question to me or are you just thinking aloud?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thinking I'll."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, no worries."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Let's think about this. Okay, well, I can use a second data structure. Again, I could keep track of what to call it. So if I ever get the third query, I would go to the second hash map and I would see that ball number one has already been colored. It's been colored to color four. In that case, I would just replace that so that ball one is now color. But. And then, but how would I get rid of this entry then? Because I need to do that. Yeah, it's kind of tricky, but do I even need to use a hash map in the first place? Maybe I could use a, a, a list of lists perhaps that could also work for me. So what I would have is the list lists. Let's rethink this. Where list I contains all of the colors that alert to color I. Okay, then in that case, let's go over the example again, see if it works. Not have. Color four is equal to one, and then color five, that's ball two. Well, I'll run into the same problem because by the time I get to 1 3, I need to have. I need to immediately have access to the fact that ball one has already been colored. So I think I would still need to use the hash map or hash set in some way. But I just need to figure out how to keep track of what balls map to what color and what colors are mapped to what balls. Okay. Is there another way I could do this though?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why don't we revisit the original approach where there was this part here and then you had a different hash map that tracks the colors and the balls that have that color."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so a hash map of color to list of balls. Like that. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or like why, why did you discard this approach? I think we could refine this."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I, at the time, I couldn't wrap my head around how I could. Like, because if I ever encounter the same ball, then I would need to remove an entry and want to one of these hashmaps. Right. Because I'm recoloring the same ball. But if I recolor the same ball, then the color four, it's gone. It's not colored on any ball anymore. So I also need to remove the 4, the color 4 on this hashmap. So I was trying to think of a way of how that could work, and that seemed a little too complicated for me, so I thought I was over complicating the problem. That's."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why wouldn't you need to remove the four anyways? Because you want to find the number of distinct colors."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, well, I can have multiple balls that are. Sorry, multiple balls that are colors in the same color. I could have like, I could have 1, 4 and then 2, 4, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And in that case, if I ignore, if I ignore this hashmap, then how would I figure out how many distinct colors there are? Well, the only way I can figure that out is if I can iterate through the whole hash map. But that's not. I don't think that's the most optimal approach because that would be. So that would be O of N squared. Because I have to iterate through the whole hash map for every query, right? And I mean that that would work, but it just wouldn't be very efficient. So I need to find a way to make it more efficient runtime wise. So If I have 1 4, 14 and 24, well, then I would go back to. Wait, it would just be a hash set, right? Of, because I only have the color 4 in here. If I add the 2, 4, then the hash set of the colors, it will stay the same because it's the same color, right? So I would know how many distinct colors there are just by the length of the hash set. Okay, so now if I remove. Sorry, if I add the 1 3, okay. I would get a new color, which is 3, but I would need to remove the 1 4. Okay, but how do I know that the 1 4, it's not. It's not the only ball that is colored to the color 4? Because if, if this was 2, 5, right? And I get this entry and I remove this, the color 4 disappears because there are no balls colored 4. But if, if it was 24 and I get 1 3, yes, I would need to remove the entry with the ball number one. But how would I know that the color four is not gone? Because there's still. The ball two is still colored to four. So, okay, in this case, I need to have the number of. I would need to make a hash map, keep track of how many balls are colored to this color. Right? So if. Let's go back to the example again. Let's do the ball, the color four. There's one ball that is colored four. And I go to this one, this query and I go to color four has two balls, color two number four. And then by the time I get to one three, I need to. I know that I need to recolor one. So I would check out what color ball number one is. Color two, which is four. So now we'll go minus one. So now only one ball is colored to number four. And I would need to add an entry of color three. And there's one ball that is colored number three, color. Okay, I think that could work because if I get the fourth entry, which is U5, I would need to recolor ball number two. So I need to go to check what color ball number two is colored. That's four for there's only one ball color number four. So I would turn that to zero. And now there's no balls color number four. So I can just safely remove this. And I would add an entry of color 5:1. And so now I know that there's two distinct colors. Okay. I think I. I think this is a solution that I think could work. Let's think about this a little more, though. Make sure it works."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, why don't we walk through, like, example three?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure, sure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's see if it works."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, I'll just say map one and then map two. Map one is the ball next to color. Map two is the color to the number of balls. All right, so first query, ball 0 gets colored to 1. So I get ball 0, color to 1. The color 0 has one ball color to it. Second 1. Second query 1, 4."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So I think for map 2, it should be 1. One is your colored one. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "1, 1. Yeah. Thanks. Second query 1, 4. Ball 1 is colored to 4. Ball 1 has not been colored before, so I can add it. And color four has never been seen on a ball before, so I could add map one. Third one, one, one. Ball one has already been colored, so I need to remove this or just replace it. And so. No, sorry. Before I replace it, I need to check the color. So color 4. There's only one ball color to it. And so I need to remove this and I need to change ball one's color to one. And let me check again. Color one already exists in the ball group, so I'll just make it two. All right. Yes, that's correct. Third query 1. 4 Ball 1 is getting colored 4. Ball 1 has already been colored. So I just replace the color. Before I replace the color, I need to check map two. You subtract by one and then change the color four. And then color four, that's one ball. And then lastly, it's still ball one. It's called recolor back to one. Okay. We call it to one. The color four. There are no balls on the floor anymore. Go to zero. Once it goes to zero, I know I can delete it. Then I look at the color again. It's color one. So it's. It becomes two. Wait, no. But it doesn't match with the output because the last digit of the output is one. That means there's only one distinct color. Oh, no, no, it's right. It's right because it's the length of the map, not the. I was looking at this. So it would be right because there's only one distinct color which is color one, and that matches with this. Okay, so I think that could work. That's why some pseudo code though. So how would my solution work? I would have array of the output that's initialized. I'd have #map1/map to defined. Okay. And now we look over once for each loop. Let's say, let's destructure the array. Let's say the color equal to array I of the first one is D the ball. Right. And the color index is a query of I to the one. Now that I have the ball index and the color index, I could check my hash maps. So when I walked over the example, I did. First of all, I need to check whether or not this particular ball has already been colored. So I need to check if not one like X, it's. If it is equal to null, then that means this ball is not colored because I haven't had an entry inside of my hash map. Whoops. Okay, if I if this ball wasn't colored, then I would need to add it map 1/add of ball index. Okay, but then I need to check whether or not the color has already been seen before. So I need to check map2. So if map.get color index is equal to null, if map2 get color index is null, then that would mean that I've never seen this color before and so the current color is distinct. That means I need to add the new color to the map too. The one is the one is for the fact that there's only one ball that's colored to that color so far. And we'll have else to handle the case where we have already seen the color in map 2. So we would just get map map 2 add color index map 2 fit color index of 1. Then we need to have an else that handles us. So if a ball has already been colored, then we need to recolor it. So okay, let's think about this. I need to first get the color that the ball was already colored to so equals not two one that fits. After I have the old color I need to check map 2. So if if not 2 get color equal to 1 map 2 dot get of the previous color is equal to 1. That that means that the there's only one color sorry one ball that's color to the previous color. So the previous color needs to be removed from mat 2. If not I just need to subtract by 1 from map 2. So I have 4 if statements. One to cover the fact that the curveball is not colored, 1 to cover the fact that it has been and 2 if statements in each to check for whether or not the color is distinct. Okay so after I'm done playing with the colors I need to add keep track of the number of distinct colors in the output array so far. Right? So I would say output of index I is equal to map map 2 dot size. And finally at the end of my algorithm I need to return out. Okay. Okay, I think I'll code it up now. So I'll say class solution for the class list and static int array fault and I'm taking in the limits and okay, so first of all I need to create an array of the output it's and then make a hash map queries less than query stop R index is equal to base of next time 0 okay, I think I just. I can just copy paste. The brackets are not lining up, but let's see. Okay, let's go over the logic. If this ball, this current ball, has not been colored, then we need to. Add it to the list of balls that are colored and then we need to check the color. If color index is null that means we've discovered the new distinct color so we need to add it to the map. If not then we just increment the previous count by one. If the ball has already been colored then we need to get the old color and subtract that from map two. That keeps track of the colors and then we need to oh I forgot to replace replace the color that the current balls color to a map one that's right say one dot java index to the new color right Then after that I add the size map to there and then finally I will return return the okay, I think the solution looks good to me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Run it. We're over time but why don't we run it just to make sure it works and then we can try all three test cases."}, {"role": "user", "content": "First example and. Of this it. Oh, I don't think I remember the syntax of inline declaration of 2D arrays."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me go ahead and look it up real quick."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I can't really go to geeks to geeks in a real interview. Right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They should be fine. You can. It's good to ask, but I think. I think it's fine."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What does it say? Yeah, not sure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Spelling error on line 81."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lowercase pre color compared pre colors. Cap, you're using camel case."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you. But I was looking at the syntax errors in these lines. Seems like I got the wrong output. Got 1, 211 instead of 1, 2 2, 3. Yeah, I think time's up though."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. Yeah. So I start with some initial feedback before I go over the rubric. I think when you're writing the pseudocode, I don't think it's the most time efficient way to write the pseudocode in this manner. Or I guess I'm further up. I'm not highlighting, I think for pseudocode. It might just be better just to write sentences. If someone who's not technical would read your sentences, they understand what you're doing. I think writing pseudocode in this manner is kind of redundant. You notice yourself too. You copy and paste it over. And I think writing sentences is a little quicker than writing all the parentheses, opening brackets and whatnot. Yeah. I think otherwise. I think your thought process, Everything was well thought out. But I'll go ahead and share my screen. Let me talk about the rubric."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Was the thought process of the solution correct, though?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That is correct. I think there might be some bugs. I mean, I didn't pick it out, but I think there's probably some bugs as to why you're getting like the wrong output. I mean, I didn't catch it off when you're coding, but I'm sure it's like a small fix because I thought your initial thought process or how you approach it is correct, though. Yeah. So I think. Let me start from the beginning. So understand the problem. I think you did a pretty good job at that. Like. Yes. Clarifying questions. Yeah. I think. And they call it like potential edge cases when you're brainstorming."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I have a question. The problem included the input of a limit. Right. But I've never used that in my entire code. Is that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That is fine. I think it's just like, however you want to use limit. Like if you wanted to initialize everything to like a no value first or however you want to handle it. Okay. Yeah. So I mean, if it's unnecessary information, then you don't need to use it. Yeah. And then solution and brainstorming. I think we could work on this a little bit in terms of the speed. I think when you were brainstorming, you would make realizations and you would adjust your approach. But then when you're then working with that new approach, you kind of forget the realization you made. So you kind of put yourself back at square one. I think to handle that, it might be helpful to kind of write down some notes here and there of things you might realized. I think over here you had something similar to this. Instead of a hashgraph, you had like color to a list or something like that. And then you were working with it. And then something, I think you forgotten realization and then were like, oh, why do I have this? But yeah, I think writing some notes here and there might be helpful just so that you could review. I think the action of writing down the notes makes you kind of. Makes it kind of stick a little better. Yeah. But otherwise, I think your thought process. And I liked how you formed your thought process. You caught up edge cases and then considered and reasoned why this or that didn't work and why this could potentially work and then eventually work through the examples. I think during your brainstorm. You did add edge cases to this example, but I think since you are given three examples, you could technically also work with these ones as well. Just to formulate your approach, don't be too fixated on one test case. I think you did a good job in coming up with edge cases, but these could also be edge cases that you don't have to come up with. They might already be there. I WOUld just try to react, read over all the examples before coming up with your approach. Just so that like, your approach is not like, only for one type of test case, but again, like, you did go over potential other test cases. So that's good."}, {"role": "user", "content": "But usually in a real interview and they give you the example cases, would the examples cover at least most of the tests? Sorry, the edge cases I would encounter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So they are not comprehensive. Sometimes they might cover a lot of the edge cases, sometimes they might not. I think normally for this problem, I won't even give you this one. So I guess, I mean, you came with the edge case yourself, so I guess, like, if you didn't come with that, you wouldn't have solved this one with your current approach. But I think it's, I guess like, what I'm saying is like, you should use a combination of the two, like reading through the examples and then coming up with your own test cases as well, just so that your approach is generalized rather than for specific, very specific edge cases or types of test cases. Sorry. Yeah, but I think good job again on coming up the edge cases and working through an example. I think coding could be. Or. Sorry, let me go back to the brainstorm. So I think when you're writing the pseudo code, I guess this belongs to this category. I think we could just write six sentences. Sorry, where's the link? Okay, so I guess, for example, like here in the pseudocode, I wouldn't really write it this way. I'll kind of write it more like. Okay, so loop with the curious ones. I think that's fine. Pseudocode, right? But I don't think we need to talk about, like, this, like, stuff. I think we could be like, if the color exists, then, like, we do this, do this, do that. Right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And like, you see how, like, this is a lot quicker to code and you don't have to act about whatever, all the different things. It's up to you. If you even want to go this far. In the pseudocode, you could write even more like one sentence. If the color is update counts and mapping, it's whatever is helpful for you. But I think this might not be. In my opinion, it's not time efficient."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think coding wise, you're pretty quick. Although I do think you should brush up. I would recommend brushing up with syntax. Like, since we had the wrong output. Right. Like, if we had the correct syntax to begin with, we could have went straight to debugging that rather than fix syntax before finally debugging this. Right. Let's see. What else? Otherwise, I think for coding, I think we could also do some better renaming of the variables. This is definitely an improvement from last time. I remember last time we were adding a bunch of comments everywhere. I think this is much better. You are relying more on the variables and the names that you give the variables to do the explanation of what you're trying to do. Right? Yeah. I think we should still make it clear, like even if we use like data tricks, map one, map two, like those should be specific. Like it would be like ball to color, color, frequency, like things that are like a little more descriptive. Right. And then. Yeah, I think that's about it for the code. Otherwise I think it looks pretty clean. We went over this. I think you were very clear and your thought process and how you explained your thoughts. I think you were pretty well spoken in that regard. Yeah, I don't have anything about this communication explanation. You did a good job in that. Throughout the interview you were talking, I guess, time, space. We didn't, I guess I didn't ask, but I think there were parts where you justified your approach as to why you didn't pursue a certain approach because it was like O of N squared and inefficient. I think providing justification for your rationale is always a good thing to do and however you do so is like up to you. But I think you named it there. So that's like a good, good way to bring up time and space complexity optimization improvement. I think when you were brainstorming, you didn't, I think, I guess you didn't explicitly do it, but I think like when you're. You had a list originally and you switched this to this, like optimizing. Right. Rather than looping through a list, you just have a frequency count. This I think we talked about earlier, that you handled it in the beginning, which is what I recommend as well. Which is exactly what you did. I didn't say too much in hints. I think I was only saying I only told you to read. Picked it up."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That led to me realizing oh2 hashmap was the way to go."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I think you came up with originally and then you kind of steered off course and I just kind of pointed you back. But I think for the most part this is all your original thought. Yeah, I think in summary, I think we want to be as time efficient as possible and writing, getting. So you want to get to coding as fast as possible and so that you allocate enough time to also do debugging. I think you had the right approach and you are able to code pretty quickly. It's just that we had a little bit of unnecessary time doing this. But I guess if it really helps you, by all means, go ahead and do this. But I think that you are capable of just going straight to some simple pseudocode. Straight to the code. Yeah. So any questions or comments?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Nope."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Yeah. So I think overall, pretty good job. Keep trying to do these mock technicals, and I'll see you next time."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bye."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hey."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How are you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm great, thank you."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right, get started then."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'll begin. Okay. A company is Planning to interview 2N people. Given the array costs where cost I of A cost I B cost I. The cost of flying the I th person to city A is a cost I and the cost of flying the I th person is city B is B cost I. Okay. Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly n people arrive in each city. Okay, let's look at an example. Input costs. So there are only two cities that we can fly people to, right? A and B. Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly n people arrive in each city. So everyone arrives in either A or everyone arrives in B. So."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or not everyone arrives in A or B. Half go to A, half go to C or half go to A, half go to B."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, okay. Half go to A, half go to B. Oh, okay. Okay. So it can't be. It has to be half. Exactly."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. Because. Okay, it says there are two N people and you need to send N."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And what do I is N the length of costs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Half of it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So this is n. This is 2n. So I'm guaranteed that. The cost array will be. There will be an even number of inputs and costs. Is that correct? Correct. Exactly. Half arrive at N, half arrive at B. Okay, so basically I need to compare the cost of flight to each city for every single person. So whoops. For person one, I can see that it's cheaper to fly to A, so maybe I'll send person one to A. And then second person A is cheaper, maybe I'll send it to A. Third person B is cheaper, maybe I'll send it to B. And then fourth person D is cheaper, so maybe I'll send it there. So I think in this example it just works to pick the cheapest city, but I think that's definitely not going to apply to every example. So let's say, let's say for the third person, it's cheaper to fly A. Now we have three. Three people that have city A as the cheapest option. But we can't fly three people at city A because we need to meet the requirement of have people in every city. So I guess there's kind of a decision tree that we need to make here or some kind of backtracking algorithm where we go over each one of the persons and for each person we can either send them to A or we can send them to B. And depending on that we will, I guess we will try every. It's possible we could just try every possible combination of every person to every city while keeping the balance equal and then just compare the cost like that. But let's see what would the time complexity of that solution be? It would be we make a decision. We have two decisions to make in every. For every candidate, there are 2N candidates. So it will be two to the power of 2N. I believe that's kind of slow. So maybe I'll think of a better way or a more efficient way to decide which, which person goes to where. Okay, let's think about it this way. Perhaps we could rank the costs so that the cheapest costs get selected first and then the more expensive flights. Get selected later. So like for example, so right now the cost applying City A is 1030. 1030. Maybe we could sort that to 1030, 30 and then just pick these. Well, we're going to run into issues again because it's not always guaranteed that we can fly the same group of people to different cities. They might overlap. We need to consider that. Okay, let's, let's see. What about, what if. Okay. I'm trying to think about whether or not I need to do some pre processing to the cost array. Like do I need to sort it by, by any, any way or should I just iterate through each one of these and figure it out as I go? I'm trying to think whether or not sorting it is going to sorting by A or sorting by B is going to help me in any way. Let's think. So if I sort it, what would I sort it by? I'll sort it by. Well, there's two cities, so I can't really decide on just one. Maybe I'll sort the cost of both cities, but how would I keep track of what cost belongs to what person? That's kind of a issue as well. So I think I probably won't try to sort the input array by any way. I think, I think the way to do it is we'll just iterate through the cost array and figure it out as we go. Maybe there's some sort of memorization we could, we can do, but I don't, I don't see it just yet."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think backtracking with memorization is definitely a way to do it, but I think we can try for something more efficient."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why don't we take a step back too? So like, I think right now we're kind of in the weeds of the code, how the code might look like. But I guess like if you were at a human, like how would you know, like which person should go here or there? Like looking at example one."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's certain individuals that should go to like a certain city. Like, like glaringly that you realize instantly, like. Oh, they should go here because of this and that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, so I see. Person one and three should definitely go to city A because they are the cheapest and. But I also have to consider that the second person should definitely not go to city B because it's going to be super expensive. So if I send person one to city A and person three to city A, that I'm going to have to send Person 2 to City B because that's how I've met the limit. And that's kind of bad because if I send person B, sorry, it's the second person, the city B, then the cost would be huge. So I guess I have to decide between who should definitely go to a city and who should definitely not go to a city."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why don't you send person 2 to city A first?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, so I'll send person A. Sorry, second person to city A, and then that's done. And then who else should go to city A? It should be. I think it should be person, person number one. So one and two goes to A."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why do you say it's one?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because I'm deciding between one and three and looking at one and three because. Oh, sorry. I think I meant to say I should send person three to City A because if I send person one to City A, then person three has to send. Has to use the $50 cost, which is a lot. But if I send two and three to City A, then I only have to send the person one to city B and that'll only cost 20 bucks, which is less than 50, and then I'll have to send person four is city A, which would be 30 bucks. And. Okay, let's see if that's. Is that the right solution? So 30 plus 10, that's city A, and then that'll be 20 plus 30 plus city B. So that's 50. That'd be 40. Okay, but that doesn't really match with the output. Wait, no. Okay, I send person to city."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think you modified the input. That's why."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, oh, sorry. Yeah, I remember now."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The original is 450."}, {"role": "user", "content": "300. Okay. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or 400. Oh, yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So look at. Looking at it like this, I can definitely know that Person two should definitely not go to city B. This person should definitely not go to city the A. So that only leaves. Well, who's you going to see the. Hey, that's. That only leaves these three people. And of the three people, this guy is the cheapest. But do I. Do I want to send him to city A for sure though?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I guess why don't we take a step further back too? Like why we. Look, why are your eyes instantly drawn to the second or third person first?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because their costs are so high. Like, they are significantly higher than the average."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or what about if the costs were also like 400 and 401 for which person? Or just say there's an extra person or. Sorry, I. I guess, like, if you had an input like 400 and 401, like, would your eyes still be drawn to this?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No. Oh, why is that looking at the difference? I. I think the key is in the difference. Because the reason why I'm drawn to this is, is because I know that it's going to be way cheaper to send this person to city A. Because if I send this to this person to city B, I'm going to be paying so much more because the difference is 170, right? I have to pay $170 more. Not the fact that it's 200, because if I have 400 with 401, then it doesn't really matter where I send him to because it's going to be expensive anyways. The cost to either one of the Cities is just $1. So although I'm gonna. Although I'm trying to get the minimum cost, I'm gonna have to pay a lot for this person anyways. So I shouldn't be too caught up by the fact that, you know, I have 400 big number. Right? I should be looking at the difference. So maybe what I'll do is I'll try to look at the difference and say I'll just do A minus B. That's how I calculate the difference. And so person one would have difference of negative 10. That would be negative 170. This person would have 350. This person would have 10. Okay. So, okay, now that I have the difference, I get a positive and a negative number. And I think that could help me decide which city each, each of these people should go to. Okay, so if I have a negative difference, that means it's cheaper to send them to A compared to B. So maybe I should just send them to A. And if I have a positive difference, that means it's cheaper to go to B compared to A. So I should send them to B. Okay, so what would example 1 output B. I would send this person to B. That would be 20 bucks. This person goes to B. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. It should go. They should go to A. 10 plus 30 plus A is 40. This person should definitely go to B. So that's 50 bucks plus 20 bucks equals 70. So 40 plus 70, that's 1 100. Okay, so now let's try this example. Difference is."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, feel free to use a calculator."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, you see the calculator."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so yeah, whatever calculator you want to use."}, {"role": "user", "content": "2, 2, 5, 9 minus 77511 negative. Yeah, I mean I could just approximate, you know, maybe it's just 400 something. Yeah, it's a negative 3, 340 something. Maybe positive, positive 40 something. This is going to be 8, 700 something. And this is going to be 100 something. Okay. Okay, so I guess I can sort this. Right, but sorted, there'll be negative 5, 1, 1, then 340. 340. The next one is 40. Okay, and then the next person is 100, 400, 700. Then I can split this in half. Right? So I'll say maybe these people, they go to. Hey, and these people, they got a B. And okay, let's see if this thinking works. So 511, that's person A. Person A goes to city A. That's 259 plus second person, negative 340. That's this person. If I send them. To. Whoops. Positive. My bad. 40 positive. Yes, positive. Okay, so 40. 40 person is. This person is 1 and 4. Okay, then I'll go next person. 100. 100 is this person. City A is 577. Let's try to calculate this. 2, 5, 9 plus 14 plus 5 sub 7 make one. Okay, let's do B. So it's these guys. 340. 340. This person. 666-67-400. This guy is 54 plus. Okay, what about 718? 67 plus 54 plus 118839 plus 10 21. 859185 9. Okay, so it works for this one. So it seems like. Okay, let's see if. Let's see if it holds up for the third example."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I don't think we need to do that. I think your approach is correct. Why don't we start coding?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "All right, so again. But I'll keep it simple. Calculate difference for each person, sort and send first half to A, second half to B. Extra cost, total cost. Okay, so this approach would be O because I know I have to sort sort the difference for the other parts. I'm just iterating through the array once and two times o n log n 2n approximately. Okay. I do believe this approach is a lot more optimal than the backtracking approach. So I'm going to begin working on the solution. I'll say class name. And so I'm returning the cost, which is an integer. Okay. Static gets total cost. And I'll say the input is just a single 2D array. So it's int missing a t."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What's that for int here? Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Then let me just write the main methods. Okay, so all right, let's calculate the difference for each person and we will keep track of it in an integer array. So let's just say int difference equals variance. That should be equal to the length, the length of this in costs. Okay. And I'm going to iterate through costs. I'll say current difference equals cost of I of It's A minus B. So it should be. The first one should be zero minus cos I of one and then that goes into the difference array which is difference. I will do words current difference. Okay, then we need to sort. So can I just. The built in method for sort."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, you can do that. Question. So when you sort by the differences, how do you know which person this corresponds to?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Ah, okay. I need to keep track. Okay. I can keep track of that with a map."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What if, what if there's the same difference though?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, what if there's. Yeah, that's a good question. So okay, let's think about this. It definitely needs to map something, but what do I map it to? By. Well, the key has to be unique and the only thing that seems to be unique."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Do we need to use a map? Like why can't we use the difference array?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Store some additional information in your different."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, perhaps I could. I can. Well, can I make this a 2D array and then store the index of costs in here. But when I sort it, it's not gonna. It's not gonna stick. It's gonna be scrambled. So maybe there's a different way. Let's think about."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What about some other down types?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, let's see. Oh, I can use an array list where I can use an array. List of integer arrays and then. Yes, okay, but I need to figure out how to model. How to override the sort method to sort by, you know, the first element in the array."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So look that up."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I'll just. I'll say of ints equals to. So let's make a new. Just delete this and host away introduction. Let's say currents of view is equal to 1. I keep track of the index, so I know who's who. Okay. And after that I need to sort it. So yeah, I need it. I need to look that up, but complete the rest of the code first. So let's just say I got the sorted version of. Let's just say I got it. What would happen if I got it? So I would need to make. I need to int for the cost equals zero and I'll do iterate through the arraylist. Hence I equals 0, I less than size person goes to the cost difference in the person number of the current person. Then I can figure out what the cost is to send that person to each city. So how do I know when to send a person A if I'm in the first half? Okay, so if, if I is less than difference size over 2 less than or less than equal. Okay, let's see. For this example there's six people. That means I'm going from index zero to five. So from 012 it's good. From 345 it's going to be. So I need six divided by three is, I'm sorry, two is three so I'll say yes, it's less than, not less than, equal to. So I'm sending these people to A. So I would get the person index equal to first of the one as the index and I would say cost is plus equal to costs of person index and I'm sending them to city A. So I'm getting the first elements which is zero. Okay, basically the same for second half except I need to get the second one which is city B. And after that I return over the cost. Okay, so now let's work on the sort part. Can I go on a different site to search?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, that's fine."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I need to make a class of herder that extends the interface. I go collections, dot sort and use stock comparator. Okay, so let's see. I'll say that's a type of. Type of integer and so public. Public and comp. Sorting in the increasing order. So."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, you can just copy and paste it over and then modify it to your needs."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Having to switch between the tabs."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So I'll say, how do they use it? Collections Sort. So a sort. Install it. All right. So guess I'll just run it. Let's say int Records. List also needs to be imported, cannot be referenced from static content. Then there's a typo here not be referenced from a static context. Okay, well, if I. If I make this method non static, then I can't reference it here because it's not static. This is tricky. I make the clothic. This is meaning, right? Program looks at it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not sure. Okay. It looks like it ran because you are returning something though. Or you can try putting a print statement."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so there's probably. Let's see, let's see. Why."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So we are at time. But I'll let you. I'll give you a couple extra minutes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, sure. Finding footprints."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's more so what you're sort. What are you sorting?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, no. Like what? Are you populating difference correctly?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm not. Forgot to populate difference. It's not cool. Okay, let's try another one, I think."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, yeah, we can run the last one, but I think looks good to me. It."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, all right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, I think that is. Did we copy the bottom part too?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think I'll increase it though. Or I'm not sure. Maybe I'll decrease it just because of the savings."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Nope. Okay. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. I guess we already went over time and space. Yeah, I don't really have anything to say. I think overall you did a pretty good job. I guess some things I would like to remind you is like. Oh, we should like, try to. Try to think about like as a human first before."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Straight into like sorting. It might help with your. Your brainstorming. Let's see. I think otherwise, the only other thing I have that stood out to me was right here. I think we can name it a little better instead of current. Like current double or something other than current or something. Yeah. Otherwise I don't have anything. I can go over the rubric."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wait, I think I forgot the question. Wait, would you say that I. Because I think I didn't really come up with the solution myself this time. You have to hit me towards the difference."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I mean, I didn't tell you explicitly. That is the difference. I'm just telling. Telling you, like, oh, how do you know? Like, I, I guess. What do you. What is your question? Sorry."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, because you. Because I was like, focusing on the, the backtracking solution, but then you told me to. To look at it a different way. So does that count as, like, a hint?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I mean, I think it counts as a hint, but, like, it's not a bad thing to receive a hint, right? I think, like, my hint is pretty general."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think because according to the school videos monster, if they give you a hint, you're basically cooked."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, I don't know about that. I think, like, there's different types of hints, right? Like, I think mine's a little more of a nudge and like, very general. I think when I told you, like, oh, you should sort by the differences, I don't think that's as like, great of a hint. Yeah, like, in terms like, that means you definitely don't are way off track. I think you're like. I think like, the way I like giving hints and I hope most interviewers do the same, is like you kind of slowly nudge the person in the right direction or the direction that the interviewer thinks is correct. And like, if you don't see the first hint, then I'll start adding more details to my hints. But I think your was very general and you're able to piece it"}, {"role": "user", "content": "if, if you were talking a lot with your approach and then your interviewer thinks that it's not in the right direction and they like, nudge you back in the right direction. That doesn't really count as too much of a hint."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I mean, I think it's like, subjective for the interviewer. I don't think this hint I gave you is like, reveals too much. Okay. Yeah, I guess, like, I wouldn't be too down if, oh, I received a hint. I'm doomed. I think, like, I think it's like, again, like, it's a collaborative experience. I think it should be more holistic. Right? Like, are you working together with the interviewer? Like, if I give you a hint and you start working like, like, let's say, like, I give you a hint and you completely discarded it and continue with your backtracking thing, then. Then it might be a little bit more concerning. Right. But the fact that you used the hint and took off and found the solution with it, and I didn't need to give you any more detailed hints, I think that's pretty good in my books already. And I, I think everything else in your coding was very smooth. I think you looking up things is fine. I think Java, I don't know. I personally stay away from Java. When I'm coding, I use Python so I don't have to deal with the fancy extra classes and public static stuff. But I think that's fine. It's fine to look things up. I think everything else, you execute it perfectly fine. Yeah. I mean, you debugged, you created your approach, and then you took off with the hint. So I think, like, I would pass you if this was an actual interview. I don't think a hint is like, means you're doomed or cooked or whatever. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Also said that if you ever go to geeks and geeks, you're cooked. If you copy any documentation, you're cooked."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I mean, I think it's like, the degree of it, like, If like, say like I think for you, right, you had a comparator class, right. Or you didn't know how to do it. Right. You knew the general idea of what you wanted, right. And then looked it up. Right. That's perfectly fine. I think if you were to look up something more general, say how do I write bfs? I think that's something you should know. Right. If you look that up and copy it over, I think that's a huge red flag. Right. But the fact that I think what I'm getting at is when you look something up, you should have an expectation of what you are trying to do. I guess, for example, if I were. Got dark in here, if you were to look up how to find how many occurrences are there for each character in a string, yes, you can do that manually. But I know in Python there's a fancy dictionary that I can import and it does it for me and see, I forgot how to import that fancy dictionary, Right. But I would tell the interviewer I know I can do this manually and I'll do it this and that way. But for conciseness, can I look this up? Like you have an expectation of what you're trying to find right now. In contrast, the other part is like what you should not be doing is like, oh, I don't know how to write bfs, let me look it up and copy it over or things like that. I think if you don't have any idea what you're looking for and you just happen to find the solution online and then copy it over, that's a huge red flag. But I think what you're doing is fine. Right? You have an expectation of what you are looking for and then you go find it and then use that? Yeah, I mean I think you did try to use the documentation. I don't think from what I read it was very useful either. So you tried another source and you stayed away from the AI generated stuff, which is fine too. Yeah, I think the way you approached looking it up was reasonable and nothing to be concerned about."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks for pointing it out."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, so I guess like, I think Aman's advice is like still something, still useful. But I think he's talking about the more like severe, like there's like a spectrum to like how much, how many hints or like what you're looking up online. I think he's more so addressing like the, the, the end of the spectrum."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, but would in an interview would they ever like give you a pretty obvious hint? Like if you really can't if you're, like, 25 minutes into it and you still have no idea. Like, would they just. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I mean, they could. I think it's dependent on the interviewer. I mean, like, sometimes if you're not. Like, sometimes, even if you're close, they might tell you the hint right away, or sometimes you're very far off, then tell you. I think it's up to the interviewer, but at least for me, I like to gently nudge you in the right direction. If you don't see it, then I'll start adding more details. But I also want to give, like, you enough time for you to, like, what happens if I said, A hint too early and then you realize and you would have came to that thought process eventually. Like, I don't think that's good either. So I usually let you, like, think for a little bit before giving a hint, but I guess, like, what the interviewer says and how they say it is, like, very, like, random, Right. If you might get a bad interviewer, you might get a good interviewer, but I wouldn't let that, like, stress you out too much. I think it's like, there are definitely things that you can control, right? Like how you incorporate their feedback and the way you brainstorm. And like, I think, like, for you, right. Like, I think you are very good at sharing your thoughts. And you go. Even if you go down, like, other paths that might not work or might not be as optimal, you call them out, which is very good. Right. Like, holistically, that is a big, strong engineer, and that's what you should be going for rather than like, oh, am I going to, like, get a bad hint or something like that. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. I hope that answers your question. I guess, like, I don't really have a straightforward answer just because the interviewer you get is kind of random."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, it does answer my question."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. So, I mean, I don't really have anything on this. I think everything you did very well. Yeah, like I mentioned, I guess like a reminder, like, when you approach prompt, try to approach as a human first. Maybe that will help you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Was my solution the most optimal solution or is it just optimal? Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. I mean, I actually received this question when I was interviewing for, like, this coach position. I had the same thoughts as you. Like, I. I'd never seen something like this, so I was like, oh, maybe I'll try backtracking. And then I realized, oh, like, something like, screams out, like, how do I know, like, this is. My eyes are listening. Drawn to this for some reason. Right? Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, I think your thought process and everything makes sense and as well executed."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. Do you want me to go over this or."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I guess. Well, you said that I did most of it pretty well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, I mean, I think everything pretty well. I don't have anything, like, I think from the past interviews, right. We've kind of, like, improved everything. Every time, like, you read the problem and you start calling out the edge cases. I think I really liked how you, like, read this and, like, was like, oh, this. Your original approach was like, oh, this happened to be just work out because, like, half are negative, half are positive. What if you tried some other number here like, or something like that. I think, like, that's good. And then, then you went into brainstorming and created your code. And then when you're creating your code, you implement it like what you did know. And then when you asked to look something up, you kind of had an expectation of what you're going for. And yeah, I mean, time complexity, space complexity, caught it early in the beginning. I mean, I guess the only thing from now the only things we can do is, like, continue to practice and, like, increase our speed and efficiency. But in terms. Execution, I think I have no comments."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Thanks for your time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, no problem. Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about or questions you want?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Me? Oh, I do have a question. So in the, in my past job searching process, I have gotten a couple of online assessments. What I wanted to ask is that do they just give out online assessments to every single person who applied or only people who pass the resume screen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's a mix of the two options that you presented."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some might be automated, some might be like a little bit of some screen before you get it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And for the online assessments, is it like, if you don't ask every single question, like basically get 100%, do you. Is it still possible to continue to the next stage or is it just. Yeah, you're cooked?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's definitely possible. Still. I think, I think it depends on the company. Some companies might be. Some companies might be very competitive. So a higher score might help you. But I don't know if they only just look at your score. I've definitely seen on like online forums where someone like bombs their oa, but then they still make it through because their experience is very good. Yeah, go ahead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because usually what I get is I get like, I get the three questions and then I get stuck on the fourth. I just run out of time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like, is this code signal?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, closing though basically the third problems, usually a medium. The first two is like easy, but then I, I run out of time and I don't get to the fourth. So."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you need to pass everything, but I think for code signal it's particularly tricky. Like one and two are like giving. Give you like three points, right? And then three is what, like some kind of brute force solution? And then four is like, relies on some tricky optimization, I think, to solve those. That just comes with practice. But I think in terms of like moving on to the next round, like, I don't think passing the OA is indicative of like, whether you make it to the next round or not. And yeah, I also guess like that Also another thing is like, if you apply early, you also have a better chance of moving on, right? Because the spots are. There are more spots open still."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And also for basically every OA I got, they told me to like open my camera and my mic. Do they ever check the recordings?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think so. I know for code signal they do. I know for code signal, I think one time I got flagged, I think I like stood up and closed the window so they saw me, like, leave my camera. So I'm not too sure what happened there. But, yeah, they do check it. I know. For code signal. They definitely do."}, {"role": "user", "content": "There was one time where I got my first ever oa and I was like. And they told me to turn on my mic and camera and I started just talking aloud. I thought they would be watching, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I think it's only to detect if you're cheating. Cheating or not. Unless the thing specifically asks for you to, like, explain what you're doing live. I wouldn't be too worried about, like, explaining what's going on."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, thanks for clarifying."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I mean, I think it's on the instructions, so whatever you might end up doing an OA on."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Yeah. That's basically all my questions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. All right, nice talking to you again. Hopefully I can do another mock with you soon. Have a good day. Feel free to quit the interview when you're ready."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How are you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks. What about you??"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks for asking. We can get started now, just go ahead and read the problem."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Meaning transformation sequence from word begin word to word end word using a dictionary. Wordless is a sequence of words, begin word, s1, s2, sk, such that every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter. Every si for one greater than I or less than K, as in word list. Okay. Note that begin word does not need to be word list. Okay. Given two words, begin word and end word, the dictionary word list, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from begin word to N word. If no such sequence exists, return zero input hits. And we're cog with this. Okay. So I'm basically trying to transform this, the hit letter by letter, and end up with cog. And I can only change the hit to one of the words in the list. Right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So. Or you can change it to multiple words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I can change multiple times, but, like, I have to go from this to this through this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So go hit, I go hot. Okay. And then the O people get this. See, let's see. Maybe not hot. Maybe it's. Do you know the answer to the examples?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. So for the first one, from hit, the only one, only words that are one letter off are hot, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And then from hot, there are only a couple words that are one letter off, and that is dot and lot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And then from dots and lot, or. I'm not giving. I guess I'm not, like, giving you the direct answer right now. I'm just walking through, like."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The possible path you can go down. Right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, okay. So what I'm seeing is it's kind of like a, a depth first search kind of thing. Right. So if I saw the hit, I look at the list, I only see hot. So I go, I go down the hot and now I have hot. I've changed the word one time, so I'm keeping track of that. Go through the list again. I see dot, dot and dog. Okay, the, then I, then I go down these two words independently. So two, two traversals go dot and then I, maybe I see another word and I send a recursion down there. And then I go from dog, maybe I see a different word and I send a recursion down. So I definitely think that this is a recursion problem and I think it's one that can be optimized by dynamic programming. Because okay, let's say that we, the N word is cog and what's the last word? Maybe we're at log, you know, the last word before we reach the end. And maybe it took us four traversals to get to log. Right. But if I'm from, you know, the other other traversals and I also arrive at log, then I'm going to look at, look at the word log and how many and check how many, how many traversals I need to get to that log. So like for example, if the current traversal takes five steps to get to log, but I already have another path that only takes four words to get to log, then I can just terminate the current path because I know that there's already a shorter way to get to the same word. Right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think you might be over complicating a little. I think there are different, there's a, might be like different ways you can get to your result that doesn't involve something as complicated as dynamic programming. Okay, maybe, maybe like I would suggest like maybe like rereading the lines 11 through 13. Maybe there's some keywords that might hint at like the type of algorithms you might use instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given two words dictionary, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from begin, word and word zero. If no such sequence exists. Okay, I don't have dynamic programming. Maybe like, I guess there has to be some other way that I can get. Keep track of what words I've been to and how many transformations it took to get there. Right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or why don't we draw out, like, the example, the first example. Like, draw all the different possible paths that hit can start with and end up with to get to cog. And then you might find that, like, we don't need to, like, cache all the possible combinations that, to get to a certain word. I think there's a better algorithm that you might have, might be familiar with."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I can get to dot and lot. Dot. Space it out a little. The dot. What do I have thought I can go. I can go back to hot, but it's obviously not going to work. I can go to dog, I can go to lot. But I mean, I see that I've already been to lot, so. Oh, maybe it's just breath research."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why might that work better?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because, you know, I. I see. I see a lot right here. Right. But I've already. If I go level by level like this, that I know that I've already been to lot, I don't need to keep track of, you know, how many traversals because I know that I've traversed three levels, so that's three times. And I see lot again and I know that I've been there, so I know it's unnecessary. Right. I don't need to revisit the same word twice."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How does that differ from, like, dfs though? Like, you're. I guess, like, why is. Why are you opting for BFS first? So dfs, because, like, you both. For both, you keep track of what you visited."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, but I don't have to keep track of how many traversals it took to get there. Well, I guess I have to, though, because, yeah, I think I would still have to keep track of the number of traversals I need to get there because I. I thought that I could infer that information based on how many levels I traversed. Like, if I get to this level, that's level three. So I know it took three steps to get to lot. And so if I see lot again in further traversals, I know that I've already seen it with less steps. That was my thinking, but I would only really be saving the dynamic. Programming array, changing it from a integer array to some sort of like hash set that keeps track of how many words I've seen. Okay, let me see if there's a better way than BFS though. Okay, so I see lot though and then let me continue the example. From dot, I go to. Okay, let's go to lot. Lot I can go to dot, I can go to log. And okay, from dog, I'm gonna go back to thought. I can go to log, but I've already seen log go to. I can go to dot, I can go to high."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "From dog, you can also go to cog."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "From dog, you can go to cog."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh yeah, cog. Okay. Oh, then I've arrived at the solution. So it took 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I'm also like not saying like BFS is wrong. I'm just asking for you, like to justify why you are choosing BFS over D DFS and vice versa."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I think I chose BFS over DFS before was that I can like, based on the level order traversal, I can figure out how many steps it took to get to every word. Whereas dfs, you have to kind of like keep track of that with, with. With an array, dynamic programming array and then like a in step counter. But I think even just going through this manually, I have to definitely keep a visited array or a hash set of some kind because like, like here, right? I. I got a lot, but I've already been a lot. I got a dot, but I've already been to dot. And there's other currencies where I go to the same bird and I definitely don't want to do that because it can basically cause an infinite loop right, where I'm stuck going through the same couple of words in a loop. So let's see if I could do this. Without recursion though. Can I do this without recursion? Can, but that wouldn't really make the algorithm faster anyway. Are you saying that there is a faster way to solve the problem without using BFS or dfs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not saying that there is a faster one. I'm just asking more for the trade off or like I think BFS is fine, it's just that I guess I'll tell you the answer I'm looking for. So I am looking for you to weigh the trade offs between BFS and dfs. Right? So BFS we know is like the shortest will result in the shortest path, right. Whereas DFS does not necessarily do that right off the bat. Right. Because we get explored a path that keeps on going and then finally come across like the shortest path."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because with BFS I can. When I get to cog, I know that, you know, the first time I see it, I know it's probably the shortest, shortest path to get there."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right, exactly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. I thought you meant that recursion or DFS or BFS wasn't the right way and there's some kind of like iterative way you could do it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think I'll do iterative for bfs. And if I'm doing level order traversal where I have to know when each level starts and ends, I have to use the two queue method. And then. Okay, I have to have like a pointer to keep track of how many level traversals I've been to. And then I have to have a. I think I'll do a hash set of strings to keep track of the words that I've already seen. Okay, so my solution is going to look something like this, where I have big use for."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The two cues, they're to keep track of. Like for me to know when the level starts and ends. So like I'll add. For one queue I'll have all of the nodes of the current level, right? So like let's say dot a lot. And when I try to add the children, I'm not going to add them to the same queue. I'm not. I'm going to add them to the second queue so that I know that these are all children and not like, not on the same level as this. So I know that. So I can keep track of how many levels I've been to, you know, and then once this queue is done, is done. I basically. Make the second queue into the first queue and then clear out the second queue so that the second queue can add these child nodes. That's how I keep track of the levels. Right. Okay, so the two queues and then int level, say traversals, number traversals. And this starts at. This starts at one. Wait, if it's possible to get that begin word and N word to be the same word, right? It's possible, yeah. So, okay, I'll make this zero, and it's. If I can go to the beginning word and word in one step, that would be one. So I'll increment this in the BFS loop. I'll just leave it at zero for now. Okay? And then I'm going to have a while loop or no, how would I know when to stop the bfs? I'll say, okay, while the first view isn't, and in the loop I'm going to say equals end word. If it is, then I'll end the I know I found the solution and I'll return it. If not, now add the child. And then if I get to the case where the first queue is empty and then it's time to switch to the next level, then I'll now go U1 equals U2, U2 equals U2. That way I could reset the. Reset the level so that the next level becomes the current level and then the next level becomes a new queue so I can add all the children. And I keep doing this, and if I keep iterating and iterating and then I get to the point where I can no longer go to the next level because I've already traversed through all the words, then I'll return zero. And of course I have to keep track of every word. Like that. Right. Okay, so that, that's going to be the BFS algorithm. But I have to figure out how do I know that a particular word in word list is one letter off from whatever word I have currently. So how do I go from, know from hit that I can go to hot and not dog. Dog Log log. I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to have an character counter, like an integer array of characters. So like hit would be 1, 1H, 1I and then 1T and maybe what's the next one? I think it goes to hot. Hot will have one H, one O and one T. And I can basically check that. Okay, these Hs are equal, keys are equal. The only difference is the O and the I, and the difference is only one. So I know that it's valid."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How do you maintain the ordering? So like, what if I had like and like some random combination?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I would have, I would store the information in an integer array that counts the number of characters. Like. So, for example, if the integer is going to have 26. Oh, by the way, the I can only get lowercase English letters in the words, right? Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's assume that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, then there'll be 26 letters in the Alphabet. Right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And so int zero equals the number, the number of A's. Right. So I could basically go over to the strings and even if they're out of order, they're going to have, if they have the same characters, they're going to show up as the same in the, the character frequency array because they're going to have the same amount of H's, same amount of T's, just different I's and O's. So the order wouldn't mess up the comparison algorithm, in my opinion."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think like, for example, like, dog and God are like two different words. Yeah. Like so, like from dog, there isn't like one letter I can, that I can switch to arrive. Like there isn't one letter I can swap out in dog to get me the word God."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, oh. I think I misread the question because the letters still have to be in the same order. Right. You can't. Yeah, not just that it's one letter off. It has to be. The order has to."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Okay. I think I misunderstood the problem. So I definitely can't do this thing. Okay, well, then I can just iterate through both of the strings and compare the characters at each of the indexes. Right? So D, G. Okay, that's, that's one difference. O and O. Okay, that's good. G and D. Okay, that's different. So the number of differences is two, and that's not valid. So I would know to, to return false for whatever method I decide to write with this. Right? Okay. Yeah, I think that could work. So I'm going to have a method and I'll call it is one R difference. And then I would iterate, iterate through these things. Check every character. If more than one difference, return false. And by the way, begin word and end word, they're, they're guaranteed to be the same length, right? Yeah. Let's assume like, and every word in word list is also the same length."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, let's assume that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So if I, if I get like game and I get N worded games, is that a valid."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, no, we won't have any of that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "All right. Okay, cool. Then I can safely just iterate through both of the strings at the same time because there's the same length. Right. I can just check the indexes because they're the same. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So. Okay. And I need to make sure that only if they're not one letter off, then I'm not going to add it. Okay. So, okay, let's. Let's go over the solution once again. Two queues. Hashtag, number of traversals, bfs. I only add the children that are within one letter off. Okay. Keep track of the words I visited. Add the child. Okay. I think I can. I think I'm going to start coding. Is that okay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, it's fine."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, I'm gonna say Q SC next bubble. So while. Okay, I have to add the first, I have to add the begin word to current level. While level is not empty, get current word from the current level. Then I'm going to check if it's the solution if. Of the source to get to the n word. If the current string is not the solution. The 92 shoulder so I'm going to say okay, I'm going to iterate through the word list and check every single word. If we have not visited this word before and it is a valid valid traversal from the current word, I'll say is valid is valid. Child of the Then I'm going to say next level and I'll say don't forget to or the current word as well. Okay, after I add all the children, I need to check whether or not the current level is empty or completely traverse through. So if current level that is empty, then I need to increase the number of traverse or the step count by one because I'm going to the next level which requires addition an additional step to get there. Then I'll say current level because next level. Next level equals okay and then if I can go through the whole BFS and not find a single solution then I'll turn 0. Now I need to implement the is our child method static string Boolean I'll say string str 1 str 2 this keeps tracks of the number of different characters. So if str1 rs I not equal to str2 char2 number difference if is greater than 1 then now false I'll return true Yep. Okay, let's check the whole thing again. Q Q visited step counter not the first word get the first word record the first word is visited Check for the solution Check all the valid children if they haven't been visited and it's a valid child how to say next level recorded as visited okay then if I go through the current level then I make then move on to the next level and the next level becomes a new queue. Okay. All right, let's try to run it. Okay. Seems like it's not working. Trying to find the issue, though. I'm going to print out the word to see which words I've traversed to. Seems like I'm not adding any valid children. Oh, by the way, can I debug with just print lines in the real and real?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I think that's usually the only way you can do it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think it might be an issue with how I'm checking the children."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "If current chart I do not equal char 2 will return false"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "or I don't think it should be two. Oh I also we are about a minute over but I'll give you like a couple extra minutes finish this up."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh cool. Five."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Five. Okay, why don't we try the I'll try three. Yeah also for your test cases I think in the future I would just have like different test cases instead of just like switching out the variables."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay cool. Should I do the two?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure. You probably get rid of these print statements too at the very end on this slide."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wait, is there I seem to delete this? Why is this line highlighted though?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, SP is not there. Sorry. Okay. You think that you can give me the time and space complexity of this?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, sure. Okay, so I'm bfs. I'm iterating I am iterating through every word at most once so this is. O of N. Okay, but what about checking the valid. Oh, the BFS of O. But for this, this is also O of N. I'm checking every word and for every one of these, I'm checking whether or not it's a valid child. So I'm iterating through the strings once. So that's O of M, where N equals the length of a string."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Longest string."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Length of the longest string."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, well, they would be the same. Right? But yeah, it is the longest string, so."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah, you're right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. So it'll be O of N. That's the bfs. That's to check the lower children. N. Hold on. No worries."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So it's all of N squared times N. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How would your code change if there's no. There was no restriction that, like, the word list has to be the same length? Like, say, what happens if, like, how would your code change if that begin word and N word had the same length? That was a requirement. But there's no requirement that the word list has to be same length of words or same length of letters."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So. Okay, well, first of all, I would know that if these are four, right. If it's. I just do ca, then there's no way, no amount of letter placing can make it match. So I would definitely just automatically ignore any strings that are where length is. Length difference is more than one."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And then."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so what do you mean when you say not the same length? If I have this and I go cre. Let's just say why not? There, there and are. They're off by one letter. But would that. Can they match?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, they can match."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. And so if I, if I go there, that can also match. Right. So first of all, I would. When I'm checking this, I'll check for length."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, you don't have to code it. Just like conceptually, I'm just pseudocoding. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And then for every single one of these, then how would I compare them? Okay, I would. You still have. Okay. Because that. They're not the same length. You can't just like compare them like this. Some. Maybe they're like that or like that. So I have to find a way to handle the different positions if they're not the same length and. Okay, then. Okay, then I would have. I can't have a hash map of the letter to the index because a word can have two of the same letters, so it can't be hashing. It has to be a different data structure that I'm saving the words to. Can I just. Since I know that the difference is only one, can I just say that I have a case where word 1 is shorter than word 2, word 1 is the same length as word 2, and then word word 2 is longer than word 1. I think that that's kind of not. It's kind of hard coding. It point."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I mean, I don't think it's hard coding. It's just like you have. Those are the three cases, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I mean, well, what if it's like, what if you change the question so that now you have like two difference, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh yeah, but like I don't think that's hard coding. I think hard coding is like saying like, oh, if my input is cat and dog automatically return two. Like I, I think that's more hard coding. I think what you're saying is like, yeah, not hard coding. It's just like breaking it down into the different cases, which is perfectly fine."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, but yeah, then, then I would know that it would not hold up. If you change the number of words, it can differ by, you know, it will only work for one word."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh yeah, but like that like your code is not supposed to handle like different length words. Like that's not the problem. That's not the initial problem I gave you. I think I just asked because like usually when you. Sometimes when you finish the interview early, they might ask you like follow up questions and I don't know, just something I figured I'd ask. I don't think that's an actual E code question though. But yeah, yeah, so I guess that was all I had. I go over the feedback. I don't think I much to say again, but I do have a question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So when I'm coding up the solution, I know that I have to make my code, like, easy to understand so that you can just read it and know what I'm doing. But do I have to still talk out loud? Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I was about to say that you should still talk when you're coding, even if it's very simple. When you're writing the main class, I think you're quiet, but you should say, oh, I'm setting up the main class. In Java, you need to run the main function to run the code. Right. I think, like, even simple code, you should. Should still be talking. Ideally, just try to keep talking the entire time. Yeah, let's see."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So should I say what I'm doing or I can't just, like, talk the code out?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, no, no, not like that. Like, don't say like, oh, string current equals. I guess I mean like English terms. Like, I am going to be initializing my array to store this."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Store that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, something like that. And then you can go ahead and type or say it after. You could also type first, say, I created this. I think it's better to do it line by line rather than you could code a chunk of code and it's like a period of silence. I think maybe before you code this, you can go like, oh, I'm going to create a queue to hold my current level. Or you say it after and then write the line of code. Um, yeah, something like that. But yeah, let's see. I have. Anything else? I think I had two other things before. Unless you wanted to say anything else."}, {"role": "user", "content": "No. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think overall, I think again, very good job. I mean, this, this is a hard question as well. So. Yeah, let's see. So I think, like, when you're doing your brainstorm at first, I wouldn't jump straight to like over complicating it. Like, you initially tried like DP and like DFS or dp. So I think it's good to still approach it with a human strategy first."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And then find out like, oh, this looks like BFS or DFS and whatnot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And also I think I've actually seen this problem before, but I forgot. Oh, and then I remember is like, I did some kind of dp. I was just following that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, okay. Yeah, I don't think it's a DP question. I think usually DP and backtrack or So I guess, in short, DP is based off of backtracking. And backtracking is usually if you can't see, like a human approach, you have to try all the different combinations, right? Yeah. And I think for this problem, you're not necessarily trying every single combination. You have, like, some direction, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So I think sometimes drawing it out might help you see that a little better. And I guess I have actually two more things on, so three things in total. So another thing is, when you're writing your test down here, you ideally want to write it as, like, a suite of tests, right? So say you have three tests, right? And you fail your third test and you make a tweak, you still want to make sure that it passes the other two tests, but then because you only have one test here, you kind of erase that input. So by writing all the inputs out at once, you can see if you make a tweak after the third test, you can still see the output of the other two tests before, right? Yeah. You see how it's a little bit more time efficient. It might be a little more costly in time to write out more test cases line by like copy and pasting it. But when you're debugging, it could potentially save you a lot more time. Right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. So I would just make this a string array and 2D array"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "or I guess like what I was. However you do it like I the way I do, I just kind of like, kind of copy and paste it and then make sure like the variables are named differently. So like it'll be like begin word one or like instead of having to begin word, I'll just put like the words or the var values inside."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I mean, you could just reassign it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean. Or like, I guess like copy comment them out or whatever. But ideally you just want them ready and the test ready to go, Right. In case you need to go back and test them again. Yeah. And then I think one other thing. I think for bfs, like a level order traversal, instead of using two cubes, I think you can use a for loop. So like when your current queue is not empty, you just loop through the current size of the queue and anything you add will be automatically on the next level."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How would I know how many to leave? Well, I can save it beforehand."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me share my screen. It's in Python, but maybe you'll get the idea too. So, so I have my while loop. This is so long. The queue is not empty and I have a while loop of my queue. Right, so how does this work? Right, So I have my queue. Say I have 1, 2 and 3, and the next choice I want to add are 4, 5 and 6. Right. So my current length is this. Right? So I'll pop off one, add four. Or let's say like the Q children are like this, right? There's like a direct relationship."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So I would pop off 1, let me switch the color and then add 4, pop off 2, add 5. Sorry if it's a little messy, pop off 3 and add 6. But because of this guard, right, of this for loop, I'm not going to visit 4 and 5 and 6 next. Right. Because of the for loop. And then once the for loop finishes, then I'll switch over. This is my next loop in the level."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wait, you can just have an array as a Q in Python, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's an array list, if I remember correctly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I think the main thing I'm getting at is, like, there's a for loop. Over the size of the current level. Current size of the queue and that. I mean, I think your way is fine too. I just think there's. I guess like they're usually the 4 level. BFS is like using a for loop inside the while loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, yeah. So because that way you only have one queue. But I mean, they technically would store."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, both still work. But like, I'm just like, this is a nitpicky thing. I think it's just like it's up to you how you code it. Whatever makes sense in your head. But I think maybe the for loop is a little bit quicker because I don't know, I think it's subjective. Right. If it makes sense in your head, by all means, keep doing it. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I got this trick from a different legal problem. I think it's the level order traversal vehicle problem. I think it's like a tree."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right. Level order and you put the result. Yeah, I think either works. Yeah. I don't think, like, don't take that as like a critique. I think in my head that just comes to me a little quicker, I think. I'm sure this way comes to you quicker. Yeah. But that's all I have. I think everything else you did perfectly. I like how you like call it out. Like the like if word list the word. Sorry. The length of the words in wordless had to be the same. And then like, things like that. I think those are all, like good cases to call out. I think I would add that maybe some additional questions edge cases you can always ask are about the inputs. Would these ever be null? Would wordless ever be null? Stuff like that. But I think your code handles it right. But I think it's like if these are null, you can return pretty automatically. Right. Without the initial line."}, {"role": "user", "content": "But other than that, I think."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Go ahead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is it okay to cache these input exceptions as I code cache the right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Wait, sorry, say that again."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Like, if I don't catch all the input exceptions in the initial brainstorming phase and I cache them without coding, is that. Does that affect anything? Is that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I mean, I don't think it affects anything. Like, I think the main thing in the beginning is that you're trying to catch like edge cases that could potentially change your entire approach. Yeah, I guess like small edge cases like, oh, is it input this and that, maybe they might change your entire approach, but most of the time they won't. But I think it's fine to catch them later on. It's just like. However is most time efficient for you right? Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, but I think that's all I have with you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. I wish you the best of luck with your career and wherever it may take you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Thanks for the time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, no problem. Best of luck! You can quit the interview when you're ready."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, is this Candidate?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, this is Candidate."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's nice to meet you. We were scheduled for an interview around now. Is now still a good time for you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, now is great."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. And since we'll need it for the bulk of the interview, are you next to a computer with internet access?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, I am."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, why don't I go ahead and read you a link that'll get you dropped into the shared editor we're going to be using for the interview. And we'll make sure that our technology works and we can kind of talk about the shape of the interview."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Great, yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Just let me know when you're ready to type in the link."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm ready."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. So it's [reads out link to shared editor]."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Cool, I think I am in."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. I think I see your name at the bottom."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Can you just type something to make sure that I can see it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. Cool."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Do you see that I've typed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sweet. Our technology works. That's good news. So a couple of things before we jump into this interview. The bulk of the interview today is going to be us working through a question in this shared document. I'm sure this is not how you normally write code. I'd be surprising if you normally wrote code talking to a stranger on the phone in a web browser. So a couple of things to try to make that a little more pleasant. First off, please write in whatever language you're most comfortable in. There's syntax highlighting for a lot of popular languages in the upper right corner of your screen, and if you want to write in one that's not out there, that's fine too. So you should feel free to change the language that you prefer."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Cool. Yeah. I'm going to go ahead and use Python 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. Sounds great. Another thing to note is that we're not going to be running your code. So while I'd like you to write real code, code that given a compiler and interpreter, you could make run, if you do the equivalent of missing a semicolon or something like that, that's totally fine. And similarly, I'm not expecting that you have the standard library for your language of choice memorized. If you forget the name of a common library function that exists, just say something and we'll agree on a reasonable API for that function."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure, sounds good."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. And then one last note is just high-level advice for what I'm looking for. We really value clear and correct code here. And so by default, I'd like you to focus on that over writing super efficient code right off the bat. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to make your code fast, and I'm always going to be happy to come back and ask you to make something faster if I'd like you to. Just that by default, I'd like you to focus on clear, readable implementations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So I'm thinking about like code structure, variable names, things like that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Cool, sounds good."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll leave a chunk of time at the end of this for any questions that you've got for me about the interview process or broadly or whatever's on your mind. But otherwise, do you have any questions about what I just described before we get started?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Nope, no questions about that. Sounds great."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. So, let's jump into it. Today, we're going to be dealing with unit conversion. Specifically, I would like to ask you to write a program that can answer unit conversion questions, like how many meters are in an inch, given a big list of conversion facts about units."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By way of example, I'm going to paste in some example facts and queries."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh, in the coder pad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, a few things to note. The top has a list of example facts, and the bottom is like a list of example queries that you should be able to answer given those facts. You don't have to do any parsing. So, I'm going to pass the facts to you as string, float, string tuples, and the query is a float, string, string tuple."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Got it. Okay, cool. Yes, makes sense."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Do you have any thoughts on how we might be able to write a function that will be able to answer these queries given those facts?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Let me think a little bit about this. So, what are we going to want to do? We're going to take in all of these facts. Are there kind of like two different steps? Like, should I expect to kind of write a function like, you know, `parse_facts`, something like this, that returns something and then, um, `answer_query`, `query_facts` or something like that? Like, is this a kind of a reasonable thing? Or, would you rather that I kind of parse the facts every query?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think this seems reasonable. What do you think?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I mean, this seems a little nicer. Just so that I can do some pre-processing up front to kind of make `answer_query` simple. I guess I could do that every time, but it seems a little nicer to do all of that work once. So let's think a little about what type of work we want to do here. I guess like, conceptually, we have a couple of different like disjoint graphs. Right? Like, there's the distance graph and the duration graph in this question and or in your example."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What do you mean by graph?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, so like we have, one node in our graph is maybe meter. And we have an edge between meter and foot. And that edge has some annotation indicating that a meter is equal to 3.28 ft. Similar for feet to inches. And then, I mean, maybe we have like one big graph and it's just not fully connected. But we have kind of a separate, series of connections between hours and minutes and minutes and seconds. Right? And I think like this is"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got you. So."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Go ahead."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Go ahead."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I just wanted to confirm, so `parse_facts` is going to take that list of facts and return some sort of like set of graphs or a graph. Is that what you're thinking?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm mostly I'm thinking about like, I think, at a high level, like let's imagine that everything was connected here. Let's imagine that there is no duration. Then like our algorithm is like pick some arbitrary starting point. Maybe we could be clever about what that starting point is. Oh, I sorry. Very clearly, never mind. We pick the node that is equivalent to like meters here because we're answering the two meter question. And then kind of do some type of like BFS or DFS. I don't actually know off the top of my head which would be more appropriate here. In keeping track of the state stored in our edges until we find our inches node. And then apply some conversion based on that state, multiplying like two by the various floats that we've stored at that edges to get 78.72. And I guess like, when doing that, the thing we want to do is, or I guess like if we explore, every node that's connected to meters, and, at no point, do we find inches, which I mean, isn't going to happen, but like this does happen with inches and hours, then we want to return not convertible instead. So I think like actually the state that I want to store, to start out, is going to be something like a dictionary that maps strings, units to some class that represents a node and a graph. And then those nodes in the graph will store like a float, node, tuple, where float is kind of the the way that we want to convert between, the node that we are operating over and the node that we're linking to. And the node that we're linking to is some other unit that we can convert to. So it stores some like, you know, edges, type of, class variable. And then our algorithm is going to be take in, a string, look it up in the dictionary, do, some traversal over the nodes kind of stored in that dictionary, and return an answer or not convertible. I think there is a clever way to keep these graphs that we're building up as small as possible. I have this vague recollection of a thing called Union find, but I don't actually really remember how it works off the top of my head. I would need to go look it up. Is it all right to kind of write the naive thing that I've sketched out here or do you want me to do something a little faster?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Absolutely. Let's go for the naive solution and see how that goes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Cool. And is the thing that I've described like somewhat reasonable, does it make sense, or is it unclear?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think this makes sense to me at a high level. So you want to construct a graph that maps from some units to some other units and you're keeping track of in your graph what that conversion rate is. Does that sound right to you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, let's maybe for the sake of being super explicit, we can make an `Edge` class. [Recruiter starts typing `class Edge:`]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "We can just go for it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[Recruiter continues typing `Edge` and `Node` classes] `class Edge: def __init__(self, multiplier, node): self.multiplier = multiplier; self.node = node`. `class Node: def __init__(self, unit): self.unit = unit; self.edges = []`. `def add_edge(self, multiplier, other_unit_node): self.edges.append((multiplier, other_unit_node))`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, hopefully that makes it a little clearer how I actually want to store this data. And then we're going to, like I said, have some dictionary that tracks individual units to their Node class. So, we can call this whatever, `name_to_node`, a dictionary."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For, and then you said this comes as unit, left unit, multiplier, right unit in facts, is that right? String float string?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yep, that seems right. String float string seems like a reasonable representation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So, what do we want to do? If `left_unit` not in `name_to_node`, `name_to_node[left_unit] = Node(left_unit)`. If `right_unit` not in `name_to_node`, `name_to_node[right_unit] = Node(right_unit)`. Then, `name_to_node[left_unit].add_edge(multiplier, name_to_node[right_unit])`. So, I think this is like somewhat reasonable. Maybe I'll come back for a second pass at that in a second. But we've got this facts dictionary, mapping units to other units. And here multiplier is something like 3.28 or 12, and the thing that I need to remember is to like multiply by it all the time and never divide by it or something like that. I can imagine having a bug there. So now, our query comes in as what? Float times left unit times right unit. So, `starting_unit_amount, from_unit, to_unit = query`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Originally I was thinking like, I am going to have some state that I kind of produce at the end of answer query. And that will be like some set of numbers multiplied by each other. But I was thinking a little more, I was like, oh, it seems a little clearer to instead, have like kind of multiply `starting_amount` in real time. That is, instead of like keeping some list around, every time we kind of traverse across some edge, multiply `starting_amount` by the value in that edge, so you just kind of keep it a running total. But I think what I actually want there depends on like how I want to solve the underlying problem here. And I want to think about that for a second. Okay. What do we want to do? I think like at a given node, we want to enqueue a tuple of like current amount and like unit to check. Yeah, so let's see. This is going to be like, given we are at some node. It has some number of edges. We want to enumerate all of those edges. And, for each of those edges, add some new tuple to a queue, where that tuple contains kind of the amount that we were already keeping track of times the amount encoded in that edge, along with the node that that edge kind of links to. When we do that, we want to be careful to not add nodes that we have seen before, so we're going to want some visited set. And I think also kind of saying all this out loud, we want to do this in kind of a BFS-y way, because the thing that we care about is finding a short path. We don't want to take some convoluted path, because we're like multiplying floats by each other and the more we like multiply floats by each other, the more likely we are to run into like weird float rounding errors."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cool. Yeah, that makes sense to me. So we're trying to write a BFS here and you're now thinking about how to effectively keep track of like the running product of these conversion rates. Does that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and so I think it's like it's a BFS but it's a little funny because I think normally, at least, I don't write that many BFSs, but I'm not normally kind of trying to like keep some other state associated with like each different kind of conceptual unit in the BFS. And but here we are. So, we want like a visited set and that contains only units. And I guess actually, `visited.add(from_unit)` at the start. Or in fact, maybe it's easier to do. How do I want to do this? I think I just need to like write out a couple of lines of code to see what this looks like. So, oh, I didn't do this right. Let's take a step back. We want this node class to have some other edges. Starts out as the empty list. And other node. I guess that's already a node class. So, `self.edges.append(multiplier, other_unit)`. We want to do something like that. Cool. And that way we can refer to edges. So, like for edge. And I guess you probably want to make that an actually you actually use the edge class there, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, totally. Yeah. Huh. Edge equals I sketched these out to make my thoughts clear and then just totally failed to use them. Multiplier, other. And let's just for explicitness, instead of calling this unit, call this node. To make it a little more clear that it is a full on node class. So we're going to grab that. Cool. And then we're going to append edge like that. So we've got this edge in. And let's not actually add from unit to the visited set yet. `to_visit.push(from_unit, starting_amount)`. And then we can do while `not to_visit.empty`: `current_unit, current_amount = to_visit.pop()`. If `current_unit == to_unit`, return `current_amount`. Or print answer equals, but presumably returning that or returning like none is maybe a reasonable API here."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yep, I think that sounds reasonable. Yep, and I think you like swapped your tuple a little, so I think it should be unit, comma, amount in your `to_visit` set. Your `to_visit` queue."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, you're totally right. `current_unit, current_amount`. Thank you for that. Yeah. All right. So, either the unit is the thing that we're looking for, or it's not. And if it's not, first we want to add it to our visited set, so `visited.add(current_unit)`. Then, for edge in `current_unit.edges`, if `edge.node` not in `visited`. If it isn't visited, we don't do anything. Otherwise, `updated_amount = current_amount * edge.multiplier`. And then we want to do `to_visit.push(edge.node, updated_amount)`. And there's something gross here, which is that if we see the same node many times here, before we process that node once, we're going to add it to `to_visit` many times. I'm going to I think so like a gross thing that we can do is also say `visited.add(edge.node)`. That feels gross to me because we're doing that twice. Maybe the right thing to do is to add this up here and special case the first node. That seems reasonable. Yeah. Cool, so we're going to push that in there. And I think that's it if it's in visited, we don't need to do anything. We've added all of the edges, adding more stuff to to visit. And if we get out here, I believe we can just return none. How does this look?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Do you want to walk through an example?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh, yeah, sure. Oh, well, there's one thing that we haven't done, I guess, like a pretty obvious thing is we've never referenced facts. So we probably want to do that. The relevant thing here is that, if `from_unit` not in `name_to_node`, return none, if `to_unit` not in `name_to_node`, return none. Otherwise, `from_node = name_to_node[from_unit]` and `to_node = name_to_node[to_unit]`. And we're going to update a couple of names here. `to_node` conceptually, I think like update all of these as well. Great. Okay. So that was kind of a glaring omission. Otherwise, I think I'm mostly convinced that this `parse_facts` is correct. So I guess I'll focus on `answer_query`. We come in, we get a query. Let's say that it is how many inches are in two meters? [Candidate pastes example above code for easier reference] So, we get in a `starting_amount`, which is two, a `starting_unit`, which is M, and an `ending_unit`, which is inches. Both are in facts because we've seen them referenced up here. We retrieve them from facts. We put `from_node` and `starting_amount` into `to_visit`. So that's meters and two. And we also put meters into the visited set. Then, we pop off meter and two. Meter is not equal to inches. So, this check doesn't fire. We enumerate our edges and our only edge is going to be feet. So we enumerate our edges, we get to feet. We add that to our visited set. We create a new multiplier, which is two times the multiplier associated with that edge, which is 3.28, so that's 6.56, I think. And then add feet and 6.56 or whatever it was that I said. We loop back up here. We're at feet now. We received a foot equals 12 inches fact. So, foot should have. Oh, you know what, one problem I'm going to run into. I'm not sure that I'm running it into it here. But I think one problem that I am going to run into eventually is that this `parse_facts` thing that I'm building up isn't bidirectional and it should be."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. That makes sense. So you're saying like, can you give me an example of what that means?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, so I think that that means up `name_to_node[right_unit].add_edge(1.0 / multiplier, name_to_node[left_unit])`. Naively, this is all we need to do. And so now we should be adding like, when we add a foot is 12 inches, we also add that an inch is 1.0 over 12 ft. And so things should kind of end up working out."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cool. Yeah, that makes sense. So given one particular fact, it actually gives you kind of two conversion rates, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, yeah, exactly. I hadn't thought about that before, but that, seems right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cool, that makes a lot of sense."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, cool. But otherwise, I think that we end up doing the right thing here. Like in the example we were walking through, we were in feet, we were enumerating its edges. We would have gotten to inches. We would have done 6.56 * 12, which I can't do in my head. We would have pushed that into our set, or into our queue. We would have popped that off. Current node would be equal to two node. They're both inches, and so we would return that amount. And I believe that, the kind of reverse case converting inches to meters would now be correct."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cool. All right, thank you so much. I said at the beginning of the interview that I would leave some time for questions, and now is that time."}]}

And basically what I want to do, and we also need to keep track of the current, right? So let me we do something like that. All right, so I need to like this is my my next guy. So okay, let me give you a visual. This is what I'm thinking about right now. So, we got A, then we got B, and he's touching C, right? And so I need to turn that into okay, if I'm reversing the list, you want this, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes. And it should be mutating the actual list that you were given.

Now C's got to point to B. Yeah, let me let's make this a D. D would be here. So C's going to be pointing backwards, and then this one's got to point all the way here. Okay, I I think I knew what I was doing when I started, but I don't know how I'm going to handle this last D guy. We'll have to see him. And just to to clarify the the the last D node points to none in Python. And here the last A node should point to none. Big D. Alright, so we're going to say our next guy here, and so we're going to say current.next. Actually, we're going to say next_guy.next is equal to the current node. So that would give B is now pointing at A, which is what we want. And then we need to go on to the next one and do the next thing. So that would then go here. So, all right, so if we go, I'm currently A, right? Cur is A. I'm telling it, I want it next. So next_guy is B. And so, I need to stick. Also, I need to keep track of what B was pointing at. So I can't just say next_guy.next. So we'll say next_next_guy. Okay. And that's next_guy.next. Before we, you know, wipe it out. And so then we set like current is equal to Do I want to set current equal to maybe next_next_guy. Actually, why don't I keep track of two nodes? That's what I'll do. Like a previous or some garbage. Some garbage. Why is the previous? Oh, this is what this is 100% what I do actually. Cuz then that's how I set it to none. So deaf, this is actually definitely how it works. So current is this, so I know at the end current.next is equal to previous. Alright, this is the only thing I know right now. Oh, you guys still have the thing? You guys need the thing where I like uh, command slash and it comments them all out? We'll do with the manual I. Oh, here we go. Let's see the Vim usual mode. We have that key bind in Sublime, but I don't think that's a Vim key bind, is it? I here. No, I had to do block mode, but it's all good. Alright, this is all I know that's right. This is this is so far guys, what I've concluded is right. This part is a little sketchy. We're going to have to figure this part out. So curr.next is equal to previous. This is what I know I think is right. Now, maybe we just need to set like a temp previous or something. So this is going to set that, and maybe just like a temp previous. Cause cause what's going to happen is we need to know that this is the next node that we're doing. So, this is going to be like temp_previous is equal to curr.next. And then we wipe it out by assigning it, and then we need to move on to this node. So we've correctly, so if we go here, okay, this this part is going to correctly set this part. A points at B. So, no, it's not. It's going to point A at A. That's good. And then this is the next one. In B, we just now need to point at B points at A. So we really just need to set A to the previous now. So here, I need to set previous is equal to actually the current. Wait, is this literally all it is? I think this might be all it is. I was overthinking this way too hard. Alright, let me let me think if this is right. So, we're going to set curr.next. All right, let's just let's play it out. Let's play it out. So, okay. We passed in A. Feel free feel free to walk through an example. Yeah, so curr.next is going to be B. And we're setting that equal to to none, okay? And then we're setting previous. Oh, we also have a We need to we need a break statement in here too. Uh, so we're setting then previous equal to A, and then the next iteration, what's going to happened is Oh, we're not setting curr though. We need to set curr. What's your curr be? Curr.next is equal. I think curr is actually just Ooh, do we need to temp next? Actually, curr, yeah, temp temp_curr is equal to curr.next cuz we're wiping out that value. And we need to know what it is. I don't know how people explain this coherently. I've been just saying temp_curr, previous, next_guy. Uh, probably when they figured it out. All right, so we have the next, cuz I didn't want to wipe this out, cuz we're wiping it out here. So I was like, we got to keep the temp value, right? And we're going to say temp_curr and we're setting this. All right, I feel pretty good about this, but I didn't think it through. So let me think it through for a second. Let's do one more run through it. All right, so what's going to happen is All right, so curr.next, that's going to be B. So, this is going to be B. All right, so this I'm setting A to none. And then previous is equal to curr. All right, what's curr right now? Curr's A. So previous is now A. Dude, I just cannot type hashtags today.

I appreciate the feedback."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're welcome! It was great interviewing you today. You did a good job breaking down the problem and communicating your thought process. Keep practicing, and you'll do great in your actual interviews."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks so much!

{"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, how are you doing today?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Recruiter, I'm doing very well, thank you. How are you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm good. So today we're going to be going over a technical interview with you. I'm going to give you a coding problem, and you're going to try and to solve it in time. Most importantly, I want to hear how your thought process is throughout this, and whether you get the solution or not, just communicate effectively throughout this. Are you ready to get started?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, that sounds good to me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is the problem. I'm going to paste it right here. Given a string S and array of string words, return the number of words I that is a subsequence of S. A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters, can be none, deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. For example, ace is a subsequence of ABCDE. So, one example that I'll provide for you is with the string ABCDE and word array of A, BB, ACD and Ace, we'll have an output of three because the subsequence that can be formed are with the strings A, ACD and ACE. BB, as you can tell, cannot be a subsequence of this string. Let me know if you have any questions about this, or if you can understand example two as well. So what are your first thoughts?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, no, this makes a lot of sense. I do have a couple of questions. Um, so if I have A B C D E, um, okay, so A makes sense because it's the first letter, and then we have BB, and because there's and because you can't repeat any characters, BB doesn't work."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And then ACD works because um, all of those exist in that order. Um, so that makes sense. And then, um, Ace also works for that same reason."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So that also makes sense. Um, one question that I had is that, can there be capital letters, or can I assume lowercase only?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can assume lowercase only. That's a good question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, and another question that I had was regarding inputs, can we have numbers, negative numbers, integers, things like that, or even extraneous characters such as like parentheses, or no?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uh, you can assume you'll have proper, only lowercase English letters. It could potentially be an empty string, but otherwise they're all going to be normal."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, and empty string would result in a zero."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Cool. That sounds good to me. Um, I guess for a brute force solution, I'm thinking that one way we could do this is, say for example, A B C D E, this would result in um, we could calculate all possible substrings. So A, AB, AC, um, given our words list. So I'll write that down. Um,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "but that kind of seems like a slow solution to me and I know that we can do much better, but, um, So calculate all possible substrings, then compare with words list. And this should be, I believe that calculating all possible substrings is two to the N operation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, where N is size of S. Um,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And S is what? The string, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, S equals strings."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "N is what?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Where N is equals to the size of S."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Does that make sense?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Cool. Um, so that would be the brute force solution. I think another possible solution that I'm thinking of is that we precompute um, location of letter to um, index. So for example, we could do taking example of A B A C, we could have a hash map of A and that would have values of zero and two, and then we would do B, which would be one, and then C, which would be three. And that would essentially give us a hash map to be able to check very quickly of all the locations of the letters, and then we could go through the words list and essentially check the hash map to see if we have a valid um, subsequence."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, could you actually like put an example of the inner workings of this structure, um, what you're talking about?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, exactly. So, I can do that right now. So, take for example, A, B, A, C, right? Then we would go through the words list and check the first substring, which is say, we want to check A, A, right? Then we would go through the map, and then for each word in the word list, we would go, oh, there's a A in the zero. So zero, and then we would check, we would delete that zero into the hash map. So the next iteration would be A goes to just two. And then we would find two, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And then that since we can go through all characters, this would result in valid."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Does that make sense?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. And what do you think the time complexity of this is?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "So time complexity, so the first precompute would be O of S. And then for each word, we have to go into, so it would be um, the essentially words the length of each word. Because each letter we're going into the hash map, which is O of one check."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "But this, yeah, so essentially like, but this should be the"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One question about that, one question about that is, um, in the case where we have essentially like A of zero and A of two, so you have one key mapping to two values, um, when we are deleting one of those values, depending on what structure is being used there, uh, would that result in additional time complexities or no?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, so depending on the structure, it would. Um, and it also resizes. But we could also use like a like a a queue or a stack, and then that would mitigate that problem because it's built on a linked list or something."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, okay. Sounds good."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And since we're just adding to the end and then popping from the beginning, that should be fine. So that's usually a stack."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. And that will keep it O of one, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Cool. Sounds good."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so I'll start by coding up the um, the optimized solution that we just discussed. To this problem. Find um, number of subsequence. And this will take in self, it doesn't need to take in self because we're not in a class, but um, and then, So first things first, we need to calculate our index map. And this will go through each um, car in S character in S and then map of character. So first I'll check if the character actually exists."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "If it does, then we get the list current, index_list equals index_map of character equals Okay, now we have current list, current index_list.append and then, Um, so we actually need the index here. So I in enumerate."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And what does the enumerate function do?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "So the enumerate function, it gives us the index, the essentially, the index and the value. So it's index value."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect. Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. And then so now because we have both, we can append the index here. So I, And then we add it back to our list, our map."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sorry, I thought we were using a stack or a queue like you had mentioned. Are we not doing that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, we can do that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the import for a stack? So I don't know if Python has a built-in stack, but Do you know the import for the stack?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Um, so you can just in this case, for the sake of this interview, you can just pop on zero. Uh, like just use the list, but pop zero, um, but I'll just assume that we use stack so we don't have to like worry too much about the complexities. I more care about your thought process."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, sounds good. Yeah. So now we have that. And then if character in index map, So now, okay, so else, that means it doesn't exist, then we create our current index list equals and then And then Okay, cool. So now we have our precomputed index map. And then now we just need to go into our map, and then um, go into each word, for word in words. And then we need a counter of words equals zero. And then we'll be returning that here. And then for word, word, compute if valid, which will take in the word, and then we'll take in, um, the index map."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And then if, then, plus equals one. Okay. So now we just need to initiate this method, and then once we do that, the solution should work. Okay, so now we have the word and then we have the index map. One thing that I'm worried about is that we should create a copy of, like a deep copy of the index map, every time we pass it in. Um, so we're making sure that we're not changing it. Um, but we can do that in this function here. So index map, um, copy equals deep copy of index map. And then, So now, because I'm pretty sure in Python, you pass by reference."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So now what I need to do is I just need to go through the map for each word, um, go through each character, and check if that in the hash map. Okay. So for character in, um, And I also need to keep track of the index of letter. Okay. For character and word actually. So if, um, in the index, so we're checking the index, um, if the word exists, um,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And if it doesn't, then we just return false."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So if it exists, then we need to pull the index. So index of current character equals index map copy of character. And the index of the current character that we pull has to actually be greater than the index of the letter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And why is that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "So say for example, um, because subsequence maintains the order of the string, right? So say for example, we have AB, um, and then in words, we have a string of A or B A."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So we need to make sure that B, um, when we're checking the next A, we need to make sure that it came before the B."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Correct."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To maintain the order. Okay, cool."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Um, and there is a chance we might have to um, go through the list in the hash map. Because if you have ABA, we would actually want to return true here. But the hash, the list will first contain the zero. But this should still return true because the A exists after. Does that make sense?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So in that case, we actually cannot use a stack."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So the list is correct."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, cool. Um, Okay, index of current character, index copy map, okay. Um, Okay, so now I have the current character, and I need to check if the index of letter is um, so okay, so if I be A, B was equal to one. Okay, so index of previous letter is has to be less than index of current character. Okay, actually in order to find find index character, we will take in the character and the index map copy. So this will actually give us the um, character that is after the last character that we had. Um, and this will take in the index of previous letter. So now we want to find the index of the character, so we're going to get the list of character. equals copy of character. And then for, So this we can also do binary search here."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And I can implement that later, but for now I'll just do the easier solution, um, for the sake of time because I want to get the correct solution out first."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "For index, if um, of previous letter is greater than index, so, Yeah, then you want to continue. Or we can just do less than here. return index. return negative one. else then we index equals to Okay, so this is gonna be just returning if current has valid. Let's see. Okay. Um, and then you go through all of this, return true here. Cool. Okay. I think this should work."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Sweet. Um, Are you ready to test it out?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Um, I'll give you the, can you write out the function that you're going to call, and then I'll put put in the inputs?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. This is the function I would call. Right here."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Cool. Let me, uh, put in the inputs. So first you have S, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, we'll say S equals A B C D E. And words equals of A, BB, ACD, ACE."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mhm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Then S comma words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uh, print that. Okay, let's run it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Invalid syntax."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh. What do you think you forgot here?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, oh, the colon."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect. Let's try running it again."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, so I think I need to import the deep copy module. I think the way it's actually done is we import copy, and then here we do copy.deep_copy. Um, and I think that should work. Um, but yeah, let's see if we get any other errors. Do you want to run it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, here, I'll hit run."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Perfect."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cool. Uh, I want to try out another test case."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right, let's run this."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Perfect. Two."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cool. Uh, did you handle the empty string scenario?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I believe so. It should work."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, cool. Now, uh, what, you don't have to code this part out, but what are ways that you might enhance this or make it better?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, so one of the things that I mentioned earlier was the function find_index_of_character, it is actually linearly checking the list, which is already ordered. Which is inefficient because that's O of N, and we could do better than that by doing binary search, which would be log N time. So that is one improvement that I would make right away. Other than that, um, I think that it runs pretty efficiently and we're using optimal space as well. But other improvements that I would make would be like more exception handling, um, to make sure that if there's invalid input, I know we mentioned that there wouldn't be, but just in case that the user puts in malicious input, that we have checks for that. So those were some things that I would change."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome. Well, Candidate, you did a really awesome job and you completed it within time. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Nope. that's everything"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great. Thanks for taking the time to interview today, see you soon!"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi. How are you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's get started. A farmer wants to farm their land with the maximum area where good land is present. The land is represented as a matrix with ones and zeros, where ones mean good land and zeros mean bad land. The farmer only wants to farm in a square of good land with the maximum area. Please help the farmer to find a maximum area of the land they can farm in good land. I'll paste the question and includes an example as well for you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "May I take a moment to read it and then ask your clarifications? Of course. Thank you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So my first question, must it be a square, the area they want to farm, or could it be a rectangle?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For this problem, we only want it to be returning a square."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Awesome. Okay, thank you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And, uh, I can think of like the naive solution, but I'll just run it by you. I can loop over every position, and for every position, I can basically start from that moment onwards, go left and right and count however many ones I can find in a square. But that would be if let's say the dimensions of the square is like N by N, that would be at best N to the four, which is not ideal. And I assume by posing this question, you want to find an efficient solution."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm wondering if you can just visualize what maybe this brute force approach would look like, maybe using the example."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure. Okay, so the brute force if I want to visualize it: I'm going to go over every index (I, J). Let's say we get to an index, for example, row two, column one. From this point, we start another double for loop, going to the right and bottom. Here I go one step to the right, there is a one, so I continue. Then I go to the bottom, there is a one and I continue. And then I go to the right of it, there's a one, I continue. First, we know we can do a one by one square. Then we ask, can we do a two by two? To answer that, we have to look in the vicinity to complete the two by two square. If yes, we say, okay, now I know I can do a two by two starting from this position. Can I do a three by three? To answer that, we have to extend the boundary by one column and one row, to check that they're all ones there. We keep track of the maximum. If we arrived at three here, then I memorize that three is the best so far. I will loop over all the indices possible, maybe update my maximum, and then return the largest number found. But as we already said, this is not optimal, but it will do the job."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think that even though this may be a brute force solution, it would be the right approach in checking the nearby values and having them inform how large the square could be."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Awesome. And I guess do you want me to program this solution or should I just think about something better?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We can just move on to maybe what you would consider a more optimal solution."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure. Okay. So, these kinds of problems, I feel like I can solve them in two other different ways. The first one would be recursive. Let's ignore the zeros, because as soon as I found a zero, we can just return from this point, you can't have a square. But let's say we get to a point where it's a one, so I can make a one by one square. Then we can ask the surroundings, can we make more than a one by one? If this is a one, and the right of it is a one, and the bottom of it is a one, we can ask the square highlighted (e.g., diagonal bottom-right), how big of a square can you make?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I think you're on the right track that you're checking the right, uh, below and diagonal values. But because there is a zero here, does that mean it could be a valid square?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Zero is invalid, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, yes. That that would be the case. So, based on that, what can you infer that if you're at that one position, at that index?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "If I'm at that index, what can you infer is the maximum square? At this index, it's a one, because we can see the diagonal is already zero."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, yes. That's correct. But you then know that the neighboring values are also ones. So there is a possibility that those could have valid squares that are greater than one."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Correct. Yes. In this specific case, because the diagonal is zero, that means the next to this one, below it, is a zero, unless we're coming from above. That's true."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I guess the one below it. Uh, actually, neither of those, but you could potentially have as you're saying, a recursive algorithm, how would that look then?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mhm. So, the recursive algorithm: when we see a one, we can ask, can this be part of a bigger square? Recursively, we ask the neighbors how many ones they have consecutively, contiguously. If there's a one here, we can invoke a recursive call that says, how many ones are starting at the right of me, making a square? If this whole area had ones, the right of me should say, \"Oh, I can do a three by three.\" When I ask this one, \"How big of a square can you form?\" it could ask the one right of it, how many can you form, it can ask the bottom of it, how many can you form? Whichever returns the minimum, I will take that, and I'll add one to it. So, if the right one said it could do a two by two, and the bottom one said it could do a three by three, then this current position can still only form a square of size two by two because it's limited by the minimum of its neighbors."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ah, I see. So, you would compute it like top down. So, that one that you've highlighted, um, in the two two coordinates, would have it contain a three value, because it can form that three by three square."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Right, exactly. Got it. Yes, that makes sense. If the red one can do a three by three, and the blue one can also do three by three, then this current position would say three is the number. However, if this was a one right here (referring to the diagonal element), it will be four."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, that would mean the diagonal number would also be three. To which case, because you have a one in that first field, what could that say? If all of the three values down, diagonal, and to your right are all three, and this is a one, what could that be?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Makes sense. Okay. So, if all the values are three, then I should say I can do four."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Make sense. Okay. Okay, so I think I'm able to write it recursively. Of course, the recursion is not the most optimal because it has to retry something multiple times. We can always add a memoization element to it. This way, each unique invocation only happens once, which will make this be at most quadratic. We will invoke it at most N square times. But usually for anything that you can do with memoization, there ought to be a dynamic programming solution where you can do bottoms up. You want me to program the recursive memoization lazy version or should I strive for the most efficient dynamic programming version?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm thinking that I want to first see your thinking for the bottom up, the dynamic programming solution, and then we can go ahead and code it. I just want to see what your thinking would be for how bottom up would look."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure. Okay. You kind of gave me a hint already by saying check the diagonal if it also can do a three by three. So, in that regard, I can use a dynamic programming array that has the same exact size as the input, but it's initialized to zero everywhere. At any moment that I want to compute an entry, I want to populate an entry in this DP matrix. I'll be looking at the same position of the input and also the surrounding positions of the input and potentially the surrounding positions of the dynamic programming array, the DP array, and populate it incrementally as such."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And so your DP array would contain what values exactly?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So, at every entry in the input, if the entry in the input is zero, then we should write zero in the dynamic programming array. If the entry is one, then we need to basically look at the surrounding positions in the dynamic programming array: the top position, just left of me, and just diagonal left of me. We should take the minimum of those, and increment by one. The final return of this whole program is the maximum entry in the DP array. Does that sound correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That sounds correct. I do want to highlight that you will be then capturing the height of the square instead of the area in this array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mhm. And if that's fine too, if that's the direction you want to go in."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Capturing the height. Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It's a square, I see. Yeah. That's right. Yes. Okay. Should I start programming the dynamic solution and I can explain it as I program it, if that's okay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That sounds great. Let's do it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so programming Python into a document. I can say `def largest_square(binary_array: list[list[int]]) -> int:`. The answer is the maximum area. So first I'm going to say my DP array is equal to an array of all zeros. I want to capture first `N`, which is the number of rows, and `M`, the number of columns. Oh, actually, the input might not be square."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Something that I wanted to point out here is that it's possible that it's an M by N. The width and the height do not agree."}, {"role": "user", "content": "May not agree. Uh, yeah. Good to know. But your output array should be a square."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so then I will do this as my N times M, and now I can say something like this (referring to initializing a 2D DP array with N rows and M columns)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, let me just make sure I'm consistent in my indexing, that if an index `IJ` exists in DP, then it must also exist in `binary_array`. Okay. So, my DP starts at all zeros. Now we're going to do the double for loop. So `for I in range N: for J in range M:`. Here, at every square, we're going to write the maximum size we could do. First, if `binary_array[I][J]` is zero, then in the DP it will have a zero, so we can just `continue`. If the code flows until this point, then here I know that it's a non-zero point (a '1'), and we need to look up the top, left, and diagonal values from the DP array. I can set `left_val`, `top_val`, `diag_val` to zero initially and then conditionally update them if the indices are valid (i.e., not on the boundary). For example, `if I > 0: top_val = dp[I-1][J]`."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Um, quick question. Is it possible to handle the boundaries before you enter this scope?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes. So, we could copy the first row and column from the input verbatim to the DP, and then our loop could start from one instead of from zeros."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Um, I'm thinking more so that if you are in the zeroth index of the row or the column, if there's a handling you could do before you enter this scope of setting the left and right diagonal indices."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, you're saying like before we enter these loops, we should handle the borders. Maybe that's what I'm hearing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maybe, yeah. I think it's possible to do it within the loop if you'd like."}, {"role": "user", "content": "We could, um."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or let me know if that doesn't sound right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I see. Okay. So, yes, I could do that. I mean, there are many ways to do it. Okay, how about this: what if I calculate the left, top, and diagonal values by multiplying with a boolean expression? For example, `left_val = dp[I][J-1] * (J > 0)`. This boolean condition will evaluate to 1 if `J > 0` and 0 if `J` is at the boundary."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. That's possible. But then what if the value is one? Then the maximum square could still be one, even in the row and column, like the edges."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Right. So, yes, here, like these right, left, and diagonal values are just for reading. I still haven't inserted anything into the DP. My plan is to insert in a moment, perhaps right now. Okay, so if `I` is greater than zero and `J` is greater than zero, then I can read my diagonal: `diag_val = dp[I-1][J-1]`. Now I want to write to `dp[I][J]`. We're brainstorming: if they're all set, then I'll read the minimum of the three and increment by one. If they're not all set, then I'll just read the minimum. What would be the deciding factor for incrementing by one? Basically, the array entry should be non-zero if we're incrementing by one. That's handled by the first if statement in the nested for loop: if we are at zero, then we just skip that entry, keeping it zero in DP. So if the code flows until this point, then I know it's a non-zero point, and the top, left, and diagonal have some numbers. Some of them could be zeros if they were boundary conditions. If they are all valid (meaning they are not 0 due to being a boundary or an actual zero in the input), then I should take the minimum plus one. Right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That makes sense. Also, if left is greater than zero, and right is greater than zero, and diag is greater than zero, then I will set the entry `DP[I][J]` to the minimum of those, left, right. I think I should put it in an array syntax wise. I forgot, but I can try that. Uh, plus one. Okay. Let me think. Is there, wait, sorry, quick question. Is there a reason why we need to check that all the values are greater than zero if we are taking the minimum here? If we've already checked that it's not a zero value, do we need to actually check that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "We don't need to. You are correct. Yes. So this if statement is irrelevant because if any of them is zero, then the minimum will also be a zero and the final answer will be a one, which is exactly what we need. You're right. This statement is not needed."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, that's perfect. Yep. Awesome. So we still don't have the final answer. The final answer is keeping track of what was the maximum. Of course, I can stay within the same computational complexity and I can just say return the max over all of this. So return, I guess I'm going to say `row_wise_max = [max(row) for row in DP]` and then I can `return max(row_wise_max)`. So, `row_wise_max` in this line basically becomes N numbers. Each number is the maximum in that row, and then return the maximum of those. So we're invoking the max function once in this for loop and once again on the list, the final list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Um, is there a way to potentially get the maximum or track the maximum within your for loop?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, there is a way. I can do that. Thank you. So, I can start `max_num` as negative one. And every time I update, I basically read off the max. So I can say `max_num = max(max_num, dp[I][J])`. And then return that at the end. Of course, there are ways to optimize it, like storing an index of an array in a temporary variable, but I'm hoping the compiler will take care of that for me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Definitely. Um, yeah, this solution looks good to me."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Awesome. And I like the fact that you kept correcting me and guiding me towards the better solution. You are a good interviewer, thank you."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was you, you were always on the right track."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I hope this gives you a better understanding of what is like to answer technical interview questions at Google. As a reminder, be sure to explain your thoughts, get clarity when possible, think through how to improve your answers and practice ahead of time. Thanks for watching and good luck in your interview."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "So, the question I'm going to give you today is, uh, I'm going to give you a collection of numbers, and I need you to take this collection of numbers and find a matching pair that is equal to a a sum that I give you as well."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, for example, the collection of numbers could be one, two, three, and nine, and the sum that I'm looking for is eight."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And then another example, just for another set of numbers, could be a one, a two, a four, and a four. And then again, the sum that I'm looking for is eight."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, in this case, there I I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, um, you're looking for a pair of numbers that add up to eight. Right? So in this case, there isn't a pair of numbers that add up to eight."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That is true for this example."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. And in this case, it is because the four and four add up to eight."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Correct."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so this is this would be like, uh, no, and this is like, yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay? Yes, so ultimately you have to tell me if the if the pair exists."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Um, so how are these numbers given? Can I assume that they're kind of like in memory, um, an array or something?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, they're in memory. You can go with an array. You can also assume that they're in that they're ordered in sending order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Oh, interesting. Okay. Um, so how about repeating elements? Can I assume that there will be like for instance, here, uh, what if I, I guess what, what if I didn't have that four? Could I use like the four and the four to get that eight?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can't repeat the same element at the same index twice, but certainly the same number may appear twice like this one."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Okay, so like that would be would be a yes. Uh, how about these numbers? Are they integers or are they floating point or?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can assume they'll always be integers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Uh, negatives, positives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uh, negatives could happen."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Cool. So, uh, well, the first, the simplest solution, of course, is just comparing every single possible pair. Uh, so I could just have two for loops, one scanning the whole thing and then the second one starting from, let's say you have the I loop and then the J loop starting from I plus one, so that I don't repeat the same value, and just testing all of them if the sum is equal to the to the target sum. Uh, I mean, that's obviously not very efficient, but that's that would be like a a way to solve it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That would work. Uh, it certainly would be time-consuming, I think, as far as optimal is concerned. So, is there any kind of example that could be a little bit faster?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes. Yeah, I think that that would be quadratic. So, better than quadratic. Uh, well, since it's sorted. So, okay, I I I guess I need to figure out when I have a number, what I'm looking for is if there's another number that sums to eight. So, so if I have a one, what I need to figure out is if there's a seven somewhere in the in the, um, array. And if that's the case, if it's sorted, then I can just do binary search. Uh, I guess if I go here and I binary search for a seven. Um, then I go here and I binary search for a six, which is the complement of that. And when I go here, I binary search for a five. And and the end I just don't do anything and so in this case I would solve it like that. Uh, so that's a bit better than quadratic, I guess. Binary search is is a log, uh, algorithm in a sorted list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Also a good answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, what if you took a look at instead of going a binary search, which is unidirectional, what if you started with a pair of numbers to begin with, and then worked your way sort of in works from there?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh, let's see. So if I, okay, let me try to bound this thing. So the, the largest possible sum, I guess, uh, would be the last two values."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That would be the largest possible sum, yes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And the smallest possible sum would be the the two smallest, right? So, so anything in between, um, ah, okay. So the range of the possible values is that, right? So there's nothing that is probably small, there's nothing that can be smaller than this value. There's nothing that can be larger than that value. Uh, that's okay. So if this sum is 10 in this case, it's too large. So I need to find a smaller sum. So I could just sort of move this one over here. And if that is too small now, then I need to move that one over there. Okay. So I can I think I can just do it with with that in a in a linear solution. Just moving at each iteration, I either move the high one lower if I am, if my pair is too large. And I move my lower higher if my pair is too small. And I end whenever I either find two, like, uh, in this case, I I either find a pair that adds up to eight, or whenever they cross. So at every at every point I'm moving one of them. So they would have to at least cross, and I move exactly one. So that means that it's linear. Yeah, so that that would be a a way of solving that problem."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And how does that how does that make that faster than a binary search?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So in the binary search case, I was doing log for finding, but I had to repeat that for every element. So that was an N log N solution. In this case, I just need to do that moving, scanning, the one time. So it's a linear solution. So that's that's faster."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right, right. Okay. So, before, maybe we could get to coding it, but before we do that, maybe you could explain, so you you explained it in a non-working example. Maybe you could follow through that same process in a working example."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Yeah. So here I would start with this and that, right? So it's five, it's smaller than eight, so I move this one here. So that's six, that's smaller than eight, so I go here and then that's eight. So that's true and I return."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Excellent. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think that would work."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So what coding language would you prefer to to do this in?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, I I prefer C++ if that's okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "C++ works. Okay. All right. Go for it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Ah, perfect. Let's see. So, okay, uh, now I realize that I haven't figured out what I need to return. So, do I want the pair, the indices of the pair, or whether I just found it or not?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, uh, for the purposes of the example, we'll go with whether you found it or not. But let's say you were going to return the pair, how could that become a problem if there was no pair?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, I mean, building the pair would be easy, right? So I I would just return the pair. If I didn't find it, then I would need to return some sort of like boolean. So I guess I could make a data structure that has a boolean that denotes whether the pair is valid or not, like has has it been found? So like a like a bull found, and then a pair, uh, values or something like that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And that ties it together. Right? Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And then this is the thing that you return. I mean, it's not very elegant, but it's workable. Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rather than going with a custom object, maybe we'll just return a boolean then."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. That that makes it a lot easier. Yes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm. Okay. So let's just call it has pair with sum, I guess. Let's, uh,"}, {"role": "user", "content": "And so I I'm okay just receiving whatever. I would like to receive it as a vector, say."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vector's fine. Yeah, sure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And we said ints are fine."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ints are fine."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh, this is my data. And then I have an int, which is my sum."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So, like I said, I want sort of an int, uh, my low, which is zero. And then my high, which is, uh, the data size minus one. And then what I'm going to do is while these are, well, while while my low is strictly lower than my high. Okay. As soon as they are touching, then I know that I can't guarantee that they're different, so that that's where I should stop. Okay? My while low is less than my high. And this also solves the problem of what happens if this is empty. Because then if this is empty, this would be a minus one. And then that would be violated, so I would never enter and access any of the value. So that that's fine. So, while low is less than high, I guess, if my data at low plus my data at high is the same as my target. Uh, my target which is called sum. Then I have found it. That's it. That's my pair. And here is where I would construct that pair if I needed to return it. But, like you say, for now I can just return true. Now, if this is larger than sum, and this is lower than sum. So, I think I'm better than just doing it three times. I'm just going to store it in a in a variable, uh, which is my S. That. And then say if S is my sum, then return true."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I'm going to stop you right there."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Excellent solution. I see what you're getting at here, but now I'm going to throw a little wrench into the mix for you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, boy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I can no longer guarantee for you that the numbers in this collection are sorted."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You have to think of a different way to to bear them against each other now."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I mean, if the first thing I do is just sort, of course, then I I solve this problem the same way, right? So that would be still an N log N solution. It would. Which would be like the same as as the the binary search as well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It would. But it's too slow for Google."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so you want faster than that. Okay. Okay, let's see. So if I go back to this idea, okay, so let me erase this. If I go back to this idea of when I look at a number, what I need to figure out is if the complement is in the rest."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The complement meaning the the yeah, the eight minus this value, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "In this case, when I have the one, I need to figure out if seven is in the rest."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "If I cannot sort and searching that will be linear, so that's not a very good idea. But maybe I can do it the other way around. So I build it up little by little, and instead of just sort of asking a blanket, is there anywhere? I just ask, have I seen it in the past? So, for instance, if I'm here, what I need to find out is if I have seen 8 minus 3. Have I seen five in the past?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That would work."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So you'd have to store five."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Or I guess it's the same, but I could be storing the complements and I just ask, have I seen three as a complement of anything of the things before? Sort of like I I I I insert a seven when I see a one."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I insert a six if I see a two."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You insert the complement."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And then, yes, I insert the complement and then when I get here, I ask, is the is this the complement of anything I have seen in the past?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, I can do, I can use a data structure that is very good for for lookups."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Right? So, I can do something like a hash table, which has like a constant time lookup. Um,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hash table though. Hash table. Do you need a key in this case?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I I guess I don't need a I mean, I just need the values, the the the the elements. I don't I don't actually want to store any payload. So, yeah, I guess a hash set would be the the thing to do. So, I hash set all of the complements and then I look for them. I I need to be careful though. Uh, how am I going to deal with the case of, uh, repeated elements? Uh, so I don't want to be able to say, oh, I have a four. Yes, of course, I have a four. I'm done. Right? I if I have this, I have a four. I'd have it, so I'm done. That would be a wrong solution. I guess I need to be careful there. So, Okay. Okay, okay. So, here's an idea. I only look for things. So, when I'm here, I only look for things that I have seen before. So, as long as I check before I insert things, that should work. And then when I add it here, this one will find that because it's in the previous one. So, I I think that works. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's good. Let's code it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Let's code it. Okay, very well. So let's see. So, like I was saying, bool of has a pair with sum, with my, oh, okay. Can I just like, uh, my vector, I mean, it's a const vector of end data. And then my int, sum. Okay. So, I need a hash set, so in C++, that's an unordered set of integers still. And I'm going to call it complements. Uh, well, I don't want to spell great complements all the time. So I'm just going to call it comp and say these are the complements. I seen whatever I need to get the target sum. And so, as I said, I just need to be building it up little by little. So I do a for, uh, my int value for each of the values in the data. I am going to first check and then insert. So, if my complement, so I check if I have seen it, first, yeah. And if I have seen it, so that means if it's not in the end, then that's it. Um, that should be a return true. Because this current element and something that I have seen in the past add up to the sum. So, obviously, depends on what I'vebeen inserting, so that's what I'm going to do here. My complements is going to be inserting I I I don't remember. I think it's add for an another set, but there's Probably. There's something. Um, it's either add or insert or something. Yeah. Yeah. So, I add not the value, but the complement, like I said. So, I do the sum minus value. I feel like I probably need to go through an example, but anyway, to make sure that this is correct. Uh, but I think that's it. Um, let me let me go through through some examples to to make sure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, so Okay. So, I have a I have a set. My my complements is a set, which starts empty. I'm going to run through both, they're kind of the same at the beginning, so that should be fine. Uh, so I have nothing in. I check for my first value, which is a one. I don't find anything, obviously. And then, uh, I add 8 minus 1. So, I add a seven here. Okay. So, now I have a seven. Um, then I go for the next one, two. I look for whether there's a two there. No, there isn't. But if I had had a six here, adding the complement would have found the two. So that would that would be good. So that that makes sense. Okay. The seven, it's not there, so I just add now the six. And here's where they start to diverge. Uh, the next case is, I get a three. Have I seen a three? No. Well, have I seen the complement of a three? No. So I just shove in the three. Uh, I I store it's complement. Good point. Yeah, and then the last one, no, I have not there's no nine here, so it would correctly return false. Now, what about the other one? The other case, I get a four. I have not seen a uh, the complement of four. So I put the four in. Because it's 8 minus 4 is 4. And then, when I get to this one, I have found it. So I correctly return true. Yeah. So the value would be four. I look here in my complements and I do find it, so I return true. Okay, so that works. Uh, what happens with an empty? Uh, the empty one should never return true because you don't have a pair, so that's fine. If you have only one thing, you never would compare again, so that's fine. So it seems like that that works. Uh, there is one issue. This could underflow. So, uh, Okay, let's not worry about that. So I think this is this is the right solution. Um, So it's linear because I am doing constant amount of work. The lookup is constant. Adding is constant for a for an unordered set, and I do it for all of the values in the input, so that's linear. And the memory is I guess linear as well because the worst case scenario I have added all of them to the set."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Would you do anything differently here if there were 10 million integers in this collection?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh, okay. So, let's see. Um, so if the input is large, does it still fit in memory or?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Probably not at this point."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So, if it doesn't fit in memory, what I can do, okay, so is the range of these values limited in some way? Um,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can assume that they might be, yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, okay, okay. So if this if my set fits in memory, but my whole input doesn't fit in memory, then I can just sort of process it in chunks, right? Uh, I chunk it and I just put it in a set and I accumulate it in a set. Uh, if we can do it in parallel, then it's kind of the same thing, right? So now you have multiple computers, each one the processing each bit of it of the input. Each one producing a, um, set of complements that this bit has seen. And we just sort of merge them. Um,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think we have enough computers available."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, so the merging would be a bit tricky because we want to make sure that again, we don't we don't sort of look for the thing that we have put in. So, uh, I guess as long as each individual computer is testing this in the right order, when we merge them, now we can say, oh, well, those two are are are correctly, um, so if I have a four in one computer and a four in the other computer, when I merge them, I would need to be careful that that I reconcile them. But other than that, I think that would be the only consideration."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great! Good job on this interview. I think that's everything today, see you next time!"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hey, let's get started."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So this is the question. I want you to design a class that supports these three operations. The first operation is inserting a value. You can assume that there are no duplicates allowed, so you might be given a duplicate, but you don't want to actually store the duplicate. The second thing is removing a value from this class. And where it gets interesting is I want you to be able to get a random value that is already inserted. Among the values that are inserted, I want it to be of equal probability. So, just these three operations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, um, all right. So, let me just repeat the question back to you to make sure I understood it. From what I understand, I have to create a class that essentially has three functions. One is to insert an element, second one is to remove an element, and the third one is to get a random value that is currently in the class. Is that correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yep, that's exactly right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are these values like integers or strings or something specific?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, you can assume that they're integers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. All right. Great. So, then let me ask you this question. Are there going to be a lot of elements we're inserting, or is it just going to be a certain amount?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uh, you can assume that it's like a reasonable amount, like less maybe like in the terms of millions, but you shouldn't run into any limitations like with memory or anything like that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So, let me ask you another question. Is there going to be more insertions done or more removals done or more get randoms done?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uh, you can assume that they'll be like of equal quantity, like equal proportion."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Thank you very much. I'm going to ask you one final question before I start coding. Can I code in Python?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So, the first thing I'm going to do is create a class. Let's just call this `Store`. We're going to start with the constructor. What are the variables we need here, right? We are inserting values and removing values, so we need a data structure to store these things. We can either use an array. If we use an array, inserting and removing might be an issue for efficiency if not at the end. It might be useful for `get_random`, since we have an index. If we use a hash map to insert these values, we can make sure that there are no duplicates. And we can make sure that inserting and removing is on average, um, very fast, O(1)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That sounds good to me. The third thing we have to consider is, we need to get a random value out of everything that is inserted. How to get a random value with equal probability?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, when it comes to the getting random, I'll actually help you out here and just let you know that you can assume that there is a method, let's call it, `random.choice`, I think in Python, and it takes some list of values and it'll return you a random number with equal probability from that list."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So, let me just start by initializing a hash map, or rather, a set since duplicates are not allowed and we don't need to store a value for a key. So, `self.data_set = set()`. For `insert(value)`, we can just do `self.data_set.add(value)`. For `remove(value)`, we can do `self.data_set.remove(value)`, possibly after checking if the value exists. For `get_random()`, if there's a function that you can just get something from a list randomly, I guess the easiest way is to just convert the set into a list and use this function on it. So, we can just do `return random.choice(list(self.data_set))`. This will be O(1) insertion, O(1) remove, and O(N) for `get_random` because of the list conversion."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, that's correct. So, this definitely works. Is it possible to get the `get_random` function to be a bit more efficient?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So, let me think about this. Since the conversion is O(N), if we use a set, we probably have to use an array to store these values for O(1) random access. The problem with using an array is the removal will be not efficient anymore, it would be O(N). Is that an issue? Or do we want all these functions to be O(1)?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, that's a good point because if we do it that way, we can get `get_random` to be more efficient, but `remove` will then be linear time. So we don't really improve anything, assuming that each of these is called an equal amount of times. So, yeah, you're on the right track. Is it possible that we can get all three of these to be constant time?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. What if every time we have a value we want to remove, we know where it is in the array? Removing from an array is constant time if it's at the end of the array. So, if every time we remove something, we switch it with the end of the array, and then remove it from the end, that will be O(1). To know where it is in the array, we can use a hash map to store the index of each value. So, for `__init__`, we'll have `self.values_list = []` and `self.map_val_to_idx = {}`. For `insert(value)`: first, check if `value in self.map_val_to_idx`. If so, return, as we don't want duplicates. Otherwise, `self.values_list.append(value)`. Then, `self.map_val_to_idx[value] = len(self.values_list) - 1`. For `remove(value)`: first, check if `value not in self.map_val_to_idx`. If so, return. Otherwise, get the index of the value to remove: `idx_to_remove = self.map_val_to_idx[value]`. Get the last value in the list: `last_val = self.values_list[-1]`. Now, move the `last_val` to the position of the element we want to remove: `self.values_list[idx_to_remove] = last_val`. Update the map for this `last_val`: `self.map_val_to_idx[last_val] = idx_to_remove`. Now, we can remove the actual last element from the list, which is now effectively the element we wanted to delete (or a copy of it): `self.values_list.pop()`. And finally, delete the original value from the map: `del self.map_val_to_idx[value]`. For `get_random()`, it would be `random.choice(self.values_list)`."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. That sounds good."}, {"role": "user", "content": "```python\nimport random\n\nclass Store:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.values_list = []\n        self.map_val_to_idx = {}\n\n    def insert(self, value):\n        if value in self.map_val_to_idx:\n            return False # Or just return, indicating no change\n        self.values_list.append(value)\n        self.map_val_to_idx[value] = len(self.values_list) - 1\n        return True\n\n    def remove(self, value):\n        if value not in self.map_val_to_idx:\n            return False\n        \n        idx_to_remove = self.map_val_to_idx[value]\n        last_val = self.values_list[-1]\n        \n        # Move the last element to the place of the element to remove\n        self.values_list[idx_to_remove] = last_val\n        # Update the index of the moved last element in the map\n        self.map_val_to_idx[last_val] = idx_to_remove\n        \n        # Remove the last element from the list\n        self.values_list.pop()\n        # Delete the removed value from the map\n        del self.map_val_to_idx[value]\n        return True\n\n    def get_random(self):\n        if not self.values_list:\n            # Handle case for empty store, e.g., return None or raise error\n            return None \n        return random.choice(self.values_list)\n\n```\nLet me run through a test case. Say we insert 3, 5, 4. `values_list` is `[3, 5, 4]`. `map_val_to_idx` is `{3:0, 5:1, 4:2}`. Now, remove 5. `value` is 5. `idx_to_remove` is 1. `last_val` is 4. `self.values_list[1]` becomes 4. So `values_list` is `[3, 4, 4]`. `self.map_val_to_idx[4]` becomes 1. `map_val_to_idx` is `{3:0, 4:1}`. `self.values_list.pop()` makes `values_list` `[3, 4]`. `del self.map_val_to_idx[5]`. So map is `{3:0, 4:1}`. This looks correct. `get_random` would pick from `[3, 4]`."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect. You got it. Yeah, that was a good catch. The code looks good. Is this code thread safe?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh, probably not. In order to make this code thread safe, we need to add locks for the insert, remove, and get_random methods to protect shared access to `self.values_list` and `self.map_val_to_idx`."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Correct. So, let's do the debrief now. First, you clarified the question well, asking about data types and constraints. That was good. You talked about the time complexity of your approaches without being prompted. When you finished the set-based solution, you correctly identified its O(N) `get_random` and then worked towards an O(1) solution for all operations. Running through the test case for the remove operation was very helpful to confirm the logic, especially with the swapping and map updates. Your final solution is correct and efficient. The follow-up on thread safety was also handled well. Overall, you demonstrated good problem-solving skills and clear communication. I would lean towards a hire for this performance."}]}
