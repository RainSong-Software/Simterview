Initially, all balls are uncolored. For every query in queries that is of the form [x, y], you mark ball x with the color y. After each query, you need to find the number of colors among the balls.\n\nReturn an array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of colors after ith query.\n\nNote that when answering a query, lack of a color will not be considered as a color.\n\n \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: limit = 4, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[1,3],[3,4]]\n\nOutput: [1,2,2,3]\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n\nAfter query 0, ball 1 has color 4.\nAfter query 1, ball 1 has color 4, and ball 2 has color 5.\nAfter query 2, ball 1 has color 3, and ball 2 has color 5.\nAfter query 3, ball 1 has color 3, ball 2 has color 5, and ball 3 has color 4.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: limit = 4, queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,2],[3,4],[4,5]]\n\nOutput: [1,2,2,3,4]\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n\nAfter query 0, ball 0 has color 1.\nAfter query 1, ball 0 has color 1, and ball 1 has color 2.\nAfter query 2, ball 0 has color 1, and balls 1 and 2 have color 2.\nAfter query 3, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, and ball 3 has color 4.\nAfter query 4, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, ball 3 has color 4, and ball 4 has color 5.\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= limit <= 109\n1 <= n == queries.length <= 105\nqueries[i].length == 2\n0 <= queries[i][0] <= limit\n1 <= queries[i][1] <= 109\n\nSOLUTION GUIDE:\nOverview\nOur task is to return an array listing the number of distinct colors after each query. Note that in this case, distinct means the number of total colors. It does not mean that the color only appears one time.\n\nLet's look at an example of a potential set of queries:\n\nCurrent\n\nIn this problem, two main scenarios can occur at each query:\n\nUncolored Ball - adding a color to a ball that did not already have a color\nColored Ball - adding a color to an already colored ball, replacing the previous color on the ball with the new color\nApproach 1: Hashmap and Array (MLE)\nIntuition\nWhen approaching this problem, the main challenge is efficiently tracking and updating the colors of the balls after each query.\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll need to track both the number of times each color appears, and the number of distinct colors.\n\nLet's consider the two different scenarios that occur when a query is applied to a ball. If the ball is:\n\nUncolored: the count of the newly assigned color is increased.\nColored: the count of the new color is increased and the count of the previously assigned color decreases.\nWhether or not the number of distinct colors is impacted will depend on the total number of balls of that color already present.\n\nA hashmap can be used for this purpose since it efficiently associates counts with specific colors.\n\nWe also need to track the current color of each ball because the problem involves overwriting existing colors. A straightforward solution is to use an array to store the color of each ball, where the index represents the ball and the value at that index represents the current color of the ball.\n\nWith these data structures in place, we can now proceed to process the queries. For each query, we update the color of the ball and adjust the count of distinct colors accordingly. As we process each query, we maintain the color count and track the balls' colors.\n\nHowever, this solution ultimately fails due to exceeding the memory limit allowed for this problem.\n\nAlgorithm\nInitialize:\nan integer n, equal to the length of queries.\nan array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of distinct colors after the ith query.\nan array ballArray, which stores the distinct ball labels found when traversing queries and the current colors associated with them.\nA hash map colorMap, which stores the number of distinct colors after processing the current query.\nIterate from index 0 to n - 1 to traverse the queries. For each query, query[i]:\nInitialize:\nan integer ball equal to query[i][0], denoting the current ball that will be colored.\nan integer color equal to query[i][1], denoting the color that the ball will be colored.\nIf ballArray[ball] is not 0, meaning the ball is already colored:\nCheck the existing color of ball, which will be labeled prevColor.\nDecrement the count of prevColor in colorMap.\nIf the count becomes 0, remove prevColor from colorMap.\nUpdate ballArray[ball] to color.\nIncrease the count of color in colorMap by one.\nSet result[i] to the size of colorMap.\nReturn the result array.\nImplementation\n\nComplexity Analysis\nLet n be the number of queries and m be the limit.\n\nTime Complexity: O(n)\n\nThe algorithm iterates through each query exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each query.\n\nSpecifically, for each query, it checks and updates the ballArray and colorMap, both of which are O(1) operations due to the use of a hash map (colorMap) and an array (ballArray).\n\nTherefore, the overall time complexity is linear in the number of queries, O(n).\n\nNote: The operations on the colorMap (such as get, put, and remove) are considered O(1) on average due to the nature of hash maps.\n\nSpace Complexity: O(m+n)\n\nThe space complexity is determined by the ballArray and the colorMap. The ballArray has a size of m+1 (since it stores the color of each ball up to the limit m), and the colorMap can store up to n distinct colors in the worst case (if all queries introduce a new color). Therefore, the space complexity is O(m+n).\n\nNote: The result array also contributes O(n) space, but since it is part of the output, it is typically not counted in the auxiliary space complexity. However, if we include it, the space complexity remains O(m+n).\n\nApproach 2: Two Hash Maps\nIntuition\nThe main challenge from the previous solution is identifying and addressing areas where large amounts of memory are used.\n\nA significant portion of our memory usage comes from the array of size limit + 1. When we look at the constraints, we can see that the value of limit can be extremely large, with the range 1 <= limit <= 10^9. Contrarily, the queries only range from 1 <= n <= 10^5, where n is the length of queries. As we navigate through the queries, we can see that not all of the ball labels are guaranteed to be accessed by the queries, leading to unnecessary memory usage.\n\nWe can improve our storage efficiency by eliminating wasted space. Here, we need to choose a data structure that only allocates space as needed. Similar to how the colors are stored, we can utilize a hash map to store only the necessary labels accessed by the queries. By doing so, we can optimize the space complexity and prevent memory overuse.\n\nAfter making this adjustment, we can apply the same logic and procedure as the previous solution. With this space optimization, we can process and track the results from the queries while staying within the memory limit.\n\nAlgorithm\nInitialize:\nan integer n, equal to the length of queries.\nan array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of distinct colors after the ith query.\ntwo hash maps:\ncolorMap, which stores the number of distinct colors after processing current query.\nballMap, which stores the distinct ball labels found when traversing queries and the current colors associated with them.\nIterate from index 0 to n-1 to traverse the queries. For each query, query[i]:\nInitialize:\nan integer ball equal to query[i][0], denoting the current ball that will be colored.\nan integer color equal to query[i][1], denoting the color that the ball will be colored.\nIf ball already exists in ballMap, meaning it is already colored:\nCheck the existing color of ball, which will be labeled prevColor.\nDecrement the count of prevColor in colorMap.\nIf the count becomes 0, remove prevColor from colorMap.\nUpdate ballMap[ball] to color.\nIncrease the count of color in colorMap by one.\nSet result[i] to the current size of colorMap.\nReturn the result array.\nImplementation\n\nComplexity Analysis\nLet n be the size of queries.\n\nTime Complexity: O(n)\n\nThe algorithm iterates through each query exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each query.\n\nSpecifically, for each query, it checks and updates the ballMap and colorMap, both of which are O(1) operations on average due to the use of hash maps.\n\nTherefore, the overall time complexity is linear in the number of queries, O(n).\n\nNote: The operations on the ballMap and colorMap (such as get, put, and remove) are considered O(1) on average due to the nature of hash maps.\n\nSpace Complexity: O(n)\n\nThe space complexity is determined by the ballMap and the colorMap.\n\nIn the worst case, ballMap can store up to n distinct colors (if all queries introduce a new ball label), and the colorMap can store up to n distinct colors (if all queries introduce a new color). Therefore, the space complexity is O(2n), which simplifies to O(n).\n\nNote: The result array also contributes O(n) space, but since it is part of the output, it is typically not counted in the auxiliary space complexity. However, if we include it, the space complexity remains O(n).\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hey. How are you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good.

You're given an integer limits and the 2D array queries of size N by 2. There are number plus 1 balls with distinct labels in each label in the range 0, the limit. Initially, the balls are uncolored.

Initially all the balls are uncolored. Okay. Wherever querying the queries, I.e. x y, you mark the ball X with the color Y after each query.

But the labels of the balls."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sorry, what's that?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's limit is not how many balls there are, it's the type of labels that they can have."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. And I can have as many queries as I want. Okay. So initially there are. So I. Initially there are. How many balls are there? Initially there are. Initially all the balls are uncolored, but. But there are limit plus one balls. Okay. With distinct labels in the range of zero limit. Okay, so from what I understand, let's say, for example, one, there are five balls. And so if I go over each of the queries, it's going to be, I'm going to color ball 12 to the color 4, and then the ball 2 to the color 5, ball 1 to the color 3, ball 3 to the color 4. Is that correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yep, it's correct."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. And so I'm trying to return an array of the number of distinct colors. And after each query. Okay, I think I understand the question now. Okay, so basically, basically I need to keep track of all of the elements in the array which are balls, and I need to keep track of how many distinct values there are inside of the array. Can. Does an uncolored ball count as a distinct color?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No. Like if you walk through the example for the first one. Like, since we have. After the first query, we've only colored one ball. Yeah, we only consider that. Whereas the other four balls are unaccounted for. Right. Because they're originally uncolored."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so what I'm thinking of right away is I can probably keep track of the number of distinct colors with a hash set. So let's say I have four, then I will add. So I would have a hash set of four in there initially, and then after that I'd have five and then three. Okay, but three, I'm recoloring the ball one to three, so that means the four gets removed. And so I. So it. There are still two colored balls. And then I go, ball three equals color four. So I think, I think instead of a hash set, I need to use a hash map because I also need to keep track of which ball is colored, what is color to what color. So what I'm thinking is I would have a hash map where the key is equal to the. Would it be the color or the ball index? It would probably be the. I think it would be the ball. Because, yes, because I can only have so many balls, but I can have as many colors as I want. So the hash set, sorry, hashmap of ball index to bullet. And then for every query, I would first check the index of the ball to see if, if that ball has already been colored because I've kept track of it with the hash map. And if it has been colored, I would remove the entry with that ball index and then replace it with the new. With the new color of the same ball. So what that will look like. And the first example is I would have. So ball one is colored to four. And then I would have ball two is color to five. And then I would. So the third query involves the first ball again. So I would check is the first ball colored? And which, which it is. So I will remove the entry with the 14 and then replace it with 1 3. Because if you color the same ball twice, the ball becomes the. The last color that you color with. Right? Okay, so then I have 2, 5, 1, 3, and then I'm going to have 3, 4, because ball three hasn't been colored. So I've reached the end of the queries and so far there are three entries in the hash map, which means that I have three distinct colors in the. In the list. Okay, But I also need to keep track of not just the duplicate balls, but duplicate colors, because if I have something like 3, 5. Oops, 3, 5. That would only mean that I have two distinct colors, because 2 is color 5 and 3 is color 5. So I also need to keep track of duplicate colors. What I could do is that I could keep track of the colors in the hash hash sets. So I would have a hash map and then a hash set. The hash map keeps track of the ball and the color, and the hash set keeps track of all the colors in the entire ball group. That worked though. Okay. So if I have a hash set to keep track of the colors, then the number of distinct distinct colors in the ball group would be. Would it be the length of the hash map or the length of the hash set? It would be the length of the hash set. Okay. Okay. So now that I have a hash map and a hash set, I need to have a way to keep track of both the ball and the color and then have a way to remove the distinct colors if a ball ever gets recolored. So let's say I have the hash set is 1, 4, 2, 5. And then I get. Sorry, the hash map would be 1425. And then the hash set would be just 4 and the 5. And so let's say I get a 1, 3, 3. Then I would need to recolor ball one, right? And so I would look at the index one because ball one's getting recolored. And I would look at what color it is. I would say four. In this case, I would need to remove four from the hash set and then add three. It has sets. Okay, but that still wouldn't work because it's possible that multiple balls have the same color. How could I keep track of the number of balls that are colored the same color? Let's think about this. Would I need to have a hash map of a color, a color to a list? So I will have a hash map of the color list of white color. It'd be like that. So what I would have, if I still come back to the example, one is I would have. I would have color four and then one there. And then I would have color five, then the ball two. Then when I reach one, three, I would have. The color three and the ball. Whoops. Color. Sorry, ball one. But if I do it like this, then I don't have access to the balls. The ball index has a key in the map, so I don't know whether or not a ball has been recolored. Okay, well, it's kind of tricky because I need to keep track of what balls map to what color and what colors are mapped to what ball. So does that mean that no matter what, I have to have two data structures to keep track of everything?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Is that a question to me or are you just thinking aloud?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thinking I'll."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, no worries."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Let's think about this. Okay, well, I can use a second data structure. Again, I could keep track of what to call it. So if I ever get the third query, I would go to the second hash map and I would see that ball number one has already been colored. It's been colored to color four. In that case, I would just replace that so that ball one is now color. But. And then, but how would I get rid of this entry then? Because I need to do that. Yeah, it's kind of tricky, but do I even need to use a hash map in the first place? Maybe I could use a, a, a list of lists perhaps that could also work for me. So what I would have is the list lists. Let's rethink this. Where list I contains all of the colors that alert to color I. Okay, then in that case, let's go over the example again, see if it works. Not have. Color four is equal to one, and then color five, that's ball two. Well, I'll run into the same problem because by the time I get to 1 3, I need to have. I need to immediately have access to the fact that ball one has already been colored. So I think I would still need to use the hash map or hash set in some way. But I just need to figure out how to keep track of what balls map to what color and what colors are mapped to what balls. Okay. Is there another way I could do this though?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why don't we revisit the original approach where there was this part here and then you had a different hash map that tracks the colors and the balls that have that color."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so a hash map of color to list of balls. Like that. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or like why, why did you discard this approach? I think we could refine this."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I, at the time, I couldn't wrap my head around how I could. Like, because if I ever encounter the same ball, then I would need to remove an entry and want to one of these hashmaps. Right. Because I'm recoloring the same ball. But if I recolor the same ball, then the color four, it's gone. It's not colored on any ball anymore. So I also need to remove the 4, the color 4 on this hashmap. So I was trying to think of a way of how that could work, and that seemed a little too complicated for me, so I thought I was over complicating the problem. That's."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why wouldn't you need to remove the four anyways? Because you want to find the number of distinct colors."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, well, I can have multiple balls that are. Sorry, multiple balls that are colors in the same color. I could have like, I could have 1, 4 and then 2, 4, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And in that case, if I ignore, if I ignore this hashmap, then how would I figure out how many distinct colors there are? Well, the only way I can figure that out is if I can iterate through the whole hash map. But that's not. I don't think that's the most optimal approach because that would be. So that would be O of N squared. Because I have to iterate through the whole hash map for every query, right? And I mean that that would work, but it just wouldn't be very efficient. So I need to find a way to make it more efficient runtime wise. So If I have 1 4, 14 and 24, well, then I would go back to. Wait, it would just be a hash set, right? Of, because I only have the color 4 in here. If I add the 2, 4, then the hash set of the colors, it will stay the same because it's the same color, right? So I would know how many distinct colors there are just by the length of the hash set. Okay, so now if I remove. Sorry, if I add the 1 3, okay. I would get a new color, which is 3, but I would need to remove the 1 4. Okay, but how do I know that the 1 4, it's not. It's not the only ball that is colored to the color 4? Because if, if this was 2, 5, right? And I get this entry and I remove this, the color 4 disappears because there are no balls colored 4. But if, if it was 24 and I get 1 3, yes, I would need to remove the entry with the ball number one. But how would I know that the color four is not gone? Because there's still. The ball two is still colored to four. So, okay, in this case, I need to have the number of. I would need to make a hash map, keep track of how many balls are colored to this color. Right? So if. Let's go back to the example again. Let's do the ball, the color four. There's one ball that is colored four. And I go to this one, this query and I go to color four has two balls, color two number four. And then by the time I get to one three, I need to. I know that I need to recolor one. So I would check out what color ball number one is. Color two, which is four. So now we'll go minus one. So now only one ball is colored to number four. And I would need to add an entry of color three. And there's one ball that is colored number three, color. Okay, I think that could work because if I get the fourth entry, which is U5, I would need to recolor ball number two. So I need to go to check what color ball number two is colored. That's four for there's only one ball color number four. So I would turn that to zero. And now there's no balls color number four. So I can just safely remove this. And I would add an entry of color 5:1. And so now I know that there's two distinct colors. Okay. I think I. I think this is a solution that I think could work. Let's think about this a little more, though. Make sure it works."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, why don't we walk through, like, example three?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure, sure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's see if it works."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, I'll just say map one and then map two. Map one is the ball next to color. Map two is the color to the number of balls. All right, so first query, ball 0 gets colored to 1. So I get ball 0, color to 1. The color 0 has one ball color to it. Second 1. Second query 1, 4."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So I think for map 2, it should be 1. One is your colored one. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "1, 1. Yeah. Thanks. Second query 1, 4. Ball 1 is colored to 4. Ball 1 has not been colored before, so I can add it. And color four has never been seen on a ball before, so I could add map one. Third one, one, one. Ball one has already been colored, so I need to remove this or just replace it. And so. No, sorry. Before I replace it, I need to check the color. So color 4. There's only one ball color to it. And so I need to remove this and I need to change ball one's color to one. And let me check again. Color one already exists in the ball group, so I'll just make it two. All right. Yes, that's correct. Third query 1. 4 Ball 1 is getting colored 4. Ball 1 has already been colored. So I just replace the color. Before I replace the color, I need to check map two. You subtract by one and then change the color four. And then color four, that's one ball. And then lastly, it's still ball one. It's called recolor back to one. Okay. We call it to one. The color four. There are no balls on the floor anymore. Go to zero. Once it goes to zero, I know I can delete it. Then I look at the color again. It's color one. So it's. It becomes two. Wait, no. But it doesn't match with the output because the last digit of the output is one. That means there's only one distinct color. Oh, no, no, it's right. It's right because it's the length of the map, not the. I was looking at this. So it would be right because there's only one distinct color which is color one, and that matches with this. Okay, so I think that could work. That's why some pseudo code though. So how would my solution work? I would have array of the output that's initialized. I'd have #map1/map to defined. Okay. And now we look over once for each loop. Let's say, let's destructure the array. Let's say the color equal to array I of the first one is D the ball. Right. And the color index is a query of I to the one. Now that I have the ball index and the color index, I could check my hash maps. So when I walked over the example, I did. First of all, I need to check whether or not this particular ball has already been colored. So I need to check if not one like X, it's. If it is equal to null, then that means this ball is not colored because I haven't had an entry inside of my hash map. Whoops. Okay, if I if this ball wasn't colored, then I would need to add it map 1/add of ball index. Okay, but then I need to check whether or not the color has already been seen before. So I need to check map2. So if map.get color index is equal to null, if map2 get color index is null, then that would mean that I've never seen this color before and so the current color is distinct. That means I need to add the new color to the map too. The one is the one is for the fact that there's only one ball that's colored to that color so far. And we'll have else to handle the case where we have already seen the color in map 2. So we would just get map map 2 add color index map 2 fit color index of 1. Then we need to have an else that handles us. So if a ball has already been colored, then we need to recolor it. So okay, let's think about this. I need to first get the color that the ball was already colored to so equals not two one that fits. After I have the old color I need to check map 2. So if if not 2 get color equal to 1 map 2 dot get of the previous color is equal to 1. That that means that the there's only one color sorry one ball that's color to the previous color. So the previous color needs to be removed from mat 2. If not I just need to subtract by 1 from map 2. So I have 4 if statements. One to cover the fact that the curveball is not colored, 1 to cover the fact that it has been and 2 if statements in each to check for whether or not the color is distinct. Okay so after I'm done playing with the colors I need to add keep track of the number of distinct colors in the output array so far. Right? So I would say output of index I is equal to map map 2 dot size. And finally at the end of my algorithm I need to return out. Okay. Okay, I think I'll code it up now. So I'll say class solution for the class list and static int array fault and I'm taking in the limits and okay, so first of all I need to create an array of the output it's and then make a hash map queries less than query stop R index is equal to base of next time 0 okay, I think I just. I can just copy paste. The brackets are not lining up, but let's see. Okay, let's go over the logic. If this ball, this current ball, has not been colored, then we need to. Add it to the list of balls that are colored and then we need to check the color. If color index is null that means we've discovered the new distinct color so we need to add it to the map. If not then we just increment the previous count by one. If the ball has already been colored then we need to get the old color and subtract that from map two. That keeps track of the colors and then we need to oh I forgot to replace replace the color that the current balls color to a map one that's right say one dot java index to the new color right Then after that I add the size map to there and then finally I will return return the okay, I think the solution looks good to me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Run it.

Right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They should be fine. You can. It's good to ask, but I think. I think it's fine."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What does it say? Yeah, not sure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Spelling error on line 81."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lowercase pre color compared pre colors. Cap, you're using camel case."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you. But I was looking at the syntax errors in these lines. Seems like I got the wrong output. Got 1, 211 instead of 1, 2 2, 3. Yeah, I think time's up though."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. Yeah. So I start with some initial feedback before I go over the rubric. I think when you're writing the pseudocode, I don't think it's the most time efficient way to write the pseudocode in this manner. Or I guess I'm further up. I'm not highlighting, I think for pseudocode. It might just be better just to write sentences. If someone who's not technical would read your sentences, they understand what you're doing. I think writing pseudocode in this manner is kind of redundant. You notice yourself too. You copy and paste it over. And I think writing sentences is a little quicker than writing all the parentheses, opening brackets and whatnot. Yeah. I think otherwise. I think your thought process, Everything was well thought out. But I'll go ahead and share my screen. Let me talk about the rubric."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Was the thought process of the solution correct, though?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That is correct. I think there might be some bugs. I mean, I didn't pick it out, but I think there's probably some bugs as to why you're getting like the wrong output. I mean, I didn't catch it off when you're coding, but I'm sure it's like a small fix because I thought your initial thought process or how you approach it is correct, though. Yeah. So I think. Let me start from the beginning. So understand the problem. I think you did a pretty good job at that. Like. Yes. Clarifying questions. Yeah. I think. And they call it like potential edge cases when you're brainstorming."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I have a question. The problem included the input of a limit. Right. But I've never used that in my entire code. Is that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That is fine. I think it's just like, however you want to use limit. Like if you wanted to initialize everything to like a no value first or however you want to handle it. Okay. Yeah. So I mean, if it's unnecessary information, then you don't need to use it. Yeah. And then solution and brainstorming. I think we could work on this a little bit in terms of the speed. I think when you were brainstorming, you would make realizations and you would adjust your approach. But then when you're then working with that new approach, you kind of forget the realization you made. So you kind of put yourself back at square one. I think to handle that, it might be helpful to kind of write down some notes here and there of things you might realized. I think over here you had something similar to this. Instead of a hashgraph, you had like color to a list or something like that. And then you were working with it. And then something, I think you forgotten realization and then were like, oh, why do I have this? But yeah, I think writing some notes here and there might be helpful just so that you could review. I think the action of writing down the notes makes you kind of. Makes it kind of stick a little better. Yeah. But otherwise, I think your thought process. And I liked how you formed your thought process. You caught up edge cases and then considered and reasoned why this or that didn't work and why this could potentially work and then eventually work through the examples. I think during your brainstorm. You did add edge cases to this example, but I think since you are given three examples, you could technically also work with these ones as well. Just to formulate your approach, don't be too fixated on one test case. I think you did a good job in coming up with edge cases, but these could also be edge cases that you don't have to come up with. They might already be there. I WOUld just try to react, read over all the examples before coming up with your approach. Just so that like, your approach is not like, only for one type of test case, but again, like, you did go over potential other test cases. So that's good."}, {"role": "user", "content": "But usually in a real interview and they give you the example cases, would the examples cover at least most of the tests? Sorry, the edge cases I would encounter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So they are not comprehensive. Sometimes they might cover a lot of the edge cases, sometimes they might not. I think normally for this problem, I won't even give you this one. So I guess, I mean, you came with the edge case yourself, so I guess, like, if you didn't come with that, you wouldn't have solved this one with your current approach. But I think it's, I guess like, what I'm saying is like, you should use a combination of the two, like reading through the examples and then coming up with your own test cases as well, just so that your approach is generalized rather than for specific, very specific edge cases or types of test cases. Sorry. Yeah, but I think good job again on coming up the edge cases and working through an example. I think coding could be. Or. Sorry, let me go back to the brainstorm. So I think when you're writing the pseudo code, I guess this belongs to this category. I think we could just write six sentences. Sorry, where's the link? Okay, so I guess, for example, like here in the pseudocode, I wouldn't really write it this way. I'll kind of write it more like. Okay, so loop with the curious ones. I think that's fine. Pseudocode, right? But I don't think we need to talk about, like, this, like, stuff. I think we could be like, if the color exists, then, like, we do this, do this, do that. Right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And like, you see how, like, this is a lot quicker to code and you don't have to act about whatever, all the different things. It's up to you. If you even want to go this far. In the pseudocode, you could write even more like one sentence. If the color is update counts and mapping, it's whatever is helpful for you. But I think this might not be. In my opinion, it's not time efficient."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think coding wise, you're pretty quick. Although I do think you should brush up. I would recommend brushing up with syntax. Like, since we had the wrong output. Right. Like, if we had the correct syntax to begin with, we could have went straight to debugging that rather than fix syntax before finally debugging this. Right. Let's see. What else? Otherwise, I think for coding, I think we could also do some better renaming of the variables. This is definitely an improvement from last time. I remember last time we were adding a bunch of comments everywhere. I think this is much better. You are relying more on the variables and the names that you give the variables to do the explanation of what you're trying to do. Right? Yeah. I think we should still make it clear, like even if we use like data tricks, map one, map two, like those should be specific. Like it would be like ball to color, color, frequency, like things that are like a little more descriptive. Right. And then. Yeah, I think that's about it for the code. Otherwise I think it looks pretty clean. We went over this. I think you were very clear and your thought process and how you explained your thoughts. I think you were pretty well spoken in that regard. Yeah, I don't have anything about this communication explanation. You did a good job in that. Throughout the interview you were talking, I guess, time, space. We didn't, I guess I didn't ask, but I think there were parts where you justified your approach as to why you didn't pursue a certain approach because it was like O of N squared and inefficient. I think providing justification for your rationale is always a good thing to do and however you do so is like up to you. But I think you named it there. So that's like a good, good way to bring up time and space complexity optimization improvement. I think when you were brainstorming, you didn't, I think, I guess you didn't explicitly do it, but I think like when you're. You had a list originally and you switched this to this, like optimizing. Right. Rather than looping through a list, you just have a frequency count. This I think we talked about earlier, that you handled it in the beginning, which is what I recommend as well. Which is exactly what you did. I didn't say too much in hints. I think I was only saying I only told you to read. Picked it up."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That led to me realizing oh2 hashmap was the way to go."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I think you came up with originally and then you kind of steered off course and I just kind of pointed you back. But I think for the most part this is all your original thought. Yeah, I think in summary, I think we want to be as time efficient as possible and writing, getting. So you want to get to coding as fast as possible and so that you allocate enough time to also do debugging. I think you had the right approach and you are able to code pretty quickly. It's just that we had a little bit of unnecessary time doing this. But I guess if it really helps you, by all means, go ahead and do this. But I think that you are capable of just going straight to some simple pseudocode. Straight to the code. Yeah. So any questions or comments?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Nope."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Yeah. So I think overall, pretty good job. Keep trying to do these mock technicals, and I'll see you next time."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bye."}]}
