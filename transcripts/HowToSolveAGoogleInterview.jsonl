{"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi. How are you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's get started. A farmer wants to farm their land with the maximum area where good land is present. The land is represented as a matrix with ones and zeros, where ones mean good land and zeros mean bad land. The farmer only wants to farm in a square of good land with the maximum area. Please help the farmer to find a maximum area of the land they can farm in good land. I'll paste the question and includes an example as well for you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "May I take a moment to read it and then ask your clarifications? Of course. Thank you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So my first question, must it be a square, the area they want to farm, or could it be a rectangle?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For this problem, we only want it to be returning a square."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Awesome. Okay, thank you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And, uh, I can think of like the naive solution, but I'll just run it by you. I can loop over every position, and for every position, I can basically start from that moment onwards, go left and right and count however many ones I can find in a square. But that would be if let's say the dimensions of the square is like N by N, that would be at best N to the four, which is not ideal. And I assume by posing this question, you want to find an efficient solution."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm wondering if you can just visualize what maybe this brute force approach would look like, maybe using the example."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure. Okay, so the brute force if I want to visualize it: I'm going to go over every index (I, J). Let's say we get to an index, for example, row two, column one. From this point, we start another double for loop, going to the right and bottom. Here I go one step to the right, there is a one, so I continue. Then I go to the bottom, there is a one and I continue. And then I go to the right of it, there's a one, I continue. First, we know we can do a one by one square. Then we ask, can we do a two by two? To answer that, we have to look in the vicinity to complete the two by two square. If yes, we say, okay, now I know I can do a two by two starting from this position. Can I do a three by three? To answer that, we have to extend the boundary by one column and one row, to check that they're all ones there. We keep track of the maximum. If we arrived at three here, then I memorize that three is the best so far. I will loop over all the indices possible, maybe update my maximum, and then return the largest number found. But as we already said, this is not optimal, but it will do the job."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think that even though this may be a brute force solution, it would be the right approach in checking the nearby values and having them inform how large the square could be."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Awesome. And I guess do you want me to program this solution or should I just think about something better?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We can just move on to maybe what you would consider a more optimal solution."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure. Okay. So, these kinds of problems, I feel like I can solve them in two other different ways. The first one would be recursive. Let's ignore the zeros, because as soon as I found a zero, we can just return from this point, you can't have a square. But let's say we get to a point where it's a one, so I can make a one by one square. Then we can ask the surroundings, can we make more than a one by one? If this is a one, and the right of it is a one, and the bottom of it is a one, we can ask the square highlighted (e.g., diagonal bottom-right), how big of a square can you make?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I think you're on the right track that you're checking the right, uh, below and diagonal values. But because there is a zero here, does that mean it could be a valid square?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Zero is invalid, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, yes. That that would be the case. So, based on that, what can you infer that if you're at that one position, at that index?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "If I'm at that index, what can you infer is the maximum square? At this index, it's a one, because we can see the diagonal is already zero."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, yes. That's correct. But you then know that the neighboring values are also ones. So there is a possibility that those could have valid squares that are greater than one."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Correct. Yes. In this specific case, because the diagonal is zero, that means the next to this one, below it, is a zero, unless we're coming from above. That's true."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I guess the one below it. Uh, actually, neither of those, but you could potentially have as you're saying, a recursive algorithm, how would that look then?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mhm. So, the recursive algorithm: when we see a one, we can ask, can this be part of a bigger square? Recursively, we ask the neighbors how many ones they have consecutively, contiguously. If there's a one here, we can invoke a recursive call that says, how many ones are starting at the right of me, making a square? If this whole area had ones, the right of me should say, \"Oh, I can do a three by three.\" When I ask this one, \"How big of a square can you form?\" it could ask the one right of it, how many can you form, it can ask the bottom of it, how many can you form? Whichever returns the minimum, I will take that, and I'll add one to it. So, if the right one said it could do a two by two, and the bottom one said it could do a three by three, then this current position can still only form a square of size two by two because it's limited by the minimum of its neighbors."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ah, I see. So, you would compute it like top down. So, that one that you've highlighted, um, in the two two coordinates, would have it contain a three value, because it can form that three by three square."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Right, exactly. Got it. Yes, that makes sense. If the red one can do a three by three, and the blue one can also do three by three, then this current position would say three is the number. However, if this was a one right here (referring to the diagonal element), it will be four."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, that would mean the diagonal number would also be three. To which case, because you have a one in that first field, what could that say? If all of the three values down, diagonal, and to your right are all three, and this is a one, what could that be?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Makes sense. Okay. So, if all the values are three, then I should say I can do four."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Make sense. Okay. Okay, so I think I'm able to write it recursively. Of course, the recursion is not the most optimal because it has to retry something multiple times. We can always add a memoization element to it. This way, each unique invocation only happens once, which will make this be at most quadratic. We will invoke it at most N square times. But usually for anything that you can do with memoization, there ought to be a dynamic programming solution where you can do bottoms up. You want me to program the recursive memoization lazy version or should I strive for the most efficient dynamic programming version?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm thinking that I want to first see your thinking for the bottom up, the dynamic programming solution, and then we can go ahead and code it. I just want to see what your thinking would be for how bottom up would look."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure. Okay. You kind of gave me a hint already by saying check the diagonal if it also can do a three by three. So, in that regard, I can use a dynamic programming array that has the same exact size as the input, but it's initialized to zero everywhere. At any moment that I want to compute an entry, I want to populate an entry in this DP matrix. I'll be looking at the same position of the input and also the surrounding positions of the input and potentially the surrounding positions of the dynamic programming array, the DP array, and populate it incrementally as such."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And so your DP array would contain what values exactly?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So, at every entry in the input, if the entry in the input is zero, then we should write zero in the dynamic programming array. If the entry is one, then we need to basically look at the surrounding positions in the dynamic programming array: the top position, just left of me, and just diagonal left of me. We should take the minimum of those, and increment by one. The final return of this whole program is the maximum entry in the DP array. Does that sound correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That sounds correct. I do want to highlight that you will be then capturing the height of the square instead of the area in this array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mhm. And if that's fine too, if that's the direction you want to go in."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Capturing the height. Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It's a square, I see. Yeah. That's right. Yes. Okay. Should I start programming the dynamic solution and I can explain it as I program it, if that's okay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That sounds great. Let's do it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so programming Python into a document. I can say `def largest_square(binary_array: list[list[int]]) -> int:`. The answer is the maximum area. So first I'm going to say my DP array is equal to an array of all zeros. I want to capture first `N`, which is the number of rows, and `M`, the number of columns. Oh, actually, the input might not be square."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Something that I wanted to point out here is that it's possible that it's an M by N. The width and the height do not agree."}, {"role": "user", "content": "May not agree. Uh, yeah. Good to know. But your output array should be a square."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so then I will do this as my N times M, and now I can say something like this (referring to initializing a 2D DP array with N rows and M columns)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, let me just make sure I'm consistent in my indexing, that if an index `IJ` exists in DP, then it must also exist in `binary_array`. Okay. So, my DP starts at all zeros. Now we're going to do the double for loop. So `for I in range N: for J in range M:`. Here, at every square, we're going to write the maximum size we could do. First, if `binary_array[I][J]` is zero, then in the DP it will have a zero, so we can just `continue`. If the code flows until this point, then here I know that it's a non-zero point (a '1'), and we need to look up the top, left, and diagonal values from the DP array. I can set `left_val`, `top_val`, `diag_val` to zero initially and then conditionally update them if the indices are valid (i.e., not on the boundary). For example, `if I > 0: top_val = dp[I-1][J]`."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Um, quick question. Is it possible to handle the boundaries before you enter this scope?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes. So, we could copy the first row and column from the input verbatim to the DP, and then our loop could start from one instead of from zeros."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Um, I'm thinking more so that if you are in the zeroth index of the row or the column, if there's a handling you could do before you enter this scope of setting the left and right diagonal indices."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, you're saying like before we enter these loops, we should handle the borders. Maybe that's what I'm hearing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maybe, yeah. I think it's possible to do it within the loop if you'd like."}, {"role": "user", "content": "We could, um."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or let me know if that doesn't sound right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I see. Okay. So, yes, I could do that. I mean, there are many ways to do it. Okay, how about this: what if I calculate the left, top, and diagonal values by multiplying with a boolean expression? For example, `left_val = dp[I][J-1] * (J > 0)`. This boolean condition will evaluate to 1 if `J > 0` and 0 if `J` is at the boundary."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. That's possible. But then what if the value is one? Then the maximum square could still be one, even in the row and column, like the edges."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Right. So, yes, here, like these right, left, and diagonal values are just for reading. I still haven't inserted anything into the DP. My plan is to insert in a moment, perhaps right now. Okay, so if `I` is greater than zero and `J` is greater than zero, then I can read my diagonal: `diag_val = dp[I-1][J-1]`. Now I want to write to `dp[I][J]`. We're brainstorming: if they're all set, then I'll read the minimum of the three and increment by one. If they're not all set, then I'll just read the minimum. What would be the deciding factor for incrementing by one? Basically, the array entry should be non-zero if we're incrementing by one. That's handled by the first if statement in the nested for loop: if we are at zero, then we just skip that entry, keeping it zero in DP. So if the code flows until this point, then I know it's a non-zero point, and the top, left, and diagonal have some numbers. Some of them could be zeros if they were boundary conditions. If they are all valid (meaning they are not 0 due to being a boundary or an actual zero in the input), then I should take the minimum plus one. Right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That makes sense. Also, if left is greater than zero, and right is greater than zero, and diag is greater than zero, then I will set the entry `DP[I][J]` to the minimum of those, left, right. I think I should put it in an array syntax wise. I forgot, but I can try that. Uh, plus one. Okay. Let me think. Is there, wait, sorry, quick question. Is there a reason why we need to check that all the values are greater than zero if we are taking the minimum here? If we've already checked that it's not a zero value, do we need to actually check that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "We don't need to. You are correct. Yes. So this if statement is irrelevant because if any of them is zero, then the minimum will also be a zero and the final answer will be a one, which is exactly what we need. You're right. This statement is not needed."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, that's perfect. Yep. Awesome. So we still don't have the final answer. The final answer is keeping track of what was the maximum. Of course, I can stay within the same computational complexity and I can just say return the max over all of this. So return, I guess I'm going to say `row_wise_max = [max(row) for row in DP]` and then I can `return max(row_wise_max)`. So, `row_wise_max` in this line basically becomes N numbers. Each number is the maximum in that row, and then return the maximum of those. So we're invoking the max function once in this for loop and once again on the list, the final list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Um, is there a way to potentially get the maximum or track the maximum within your for loop?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, there is a way. I can do that. Thank you. So, I can start `max_num` as negative one. And every time I update, I basically read off the max. So I can say `max_num = max(max_num, dp[I][J])`. And then return that at the end. Of course, there are ways to optimize it, like storing an index of an array in a temporary variable, but I'm hoping the compiler will take care of that for me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Definitely. Um, yeah, this solution looks good to me."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Awesome. And I like the fact that you kept correcting me and guiding me towards the better solution. You are a good interviewer, thank you."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was you, you were always on the right track."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I hope this gives you a better understanding of what is like to answer technical interview questions at Google. As a reminder, be sure to explain your thoughts, get clarity when possible, think through how to improve your answers and practice ahead of time. Thanks for watching and good luck in your interview."}]}
