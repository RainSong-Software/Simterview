{"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "So, the question I'm going to give you today is, uh, I'm going to give you a collection of numbers, and I need you to take this collection of numbers and find a matching pair that is equal to a a sum that I give you as well."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, for example, the collection of numbers could be one, two, three, and nine, and the sum that I'm looking for is eight."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And then another example, just for another set of numbers, could be a one, a two, a four, and a four. And then again, the sum that I'm looking for is eight."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, in this case, there I I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, um, you're looking for a pair of numbers that add up to eight. Right? So in this case, there isn't a pair of numbers that add up to eight."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That is true for this example."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. And in this case, it is because the four and four add up to eight."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Correct."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so this is this would be like, uh, no, and this is like, yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay? Yes, so ultimately you have to tell me if the if the pair exists."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Um, so how are these numbers given? Can I assume that they're kind of like in memory, um, an array or something?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, they're in memory. You can go with an array. You can also assume that they're in that they're ordered in sending order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Oh, interesting. Okay. Um, so how about repeating elements? Can I assume that there will be like for instance, here, uh, what if I, I guess what, what if I didn't have that four? Could I use like the four and the four to get that eight?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can't repeat the same element at the same index twice, but certainly the same number may appear twice like this one."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Okay, so like that would be would be a yes. Uh, how about these numbers? Are they integers or are they floating point or?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can assume they'll always be integers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Uh, negatives, positives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uh, negatives could happen."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Cool. So, uh, well, the first, the simplest solution, of course, is just comparing every single possible pair. Uh, so I could just have two for loops, one scanning the whole thing and then the second one starting from, let's say you have the I loop and then the J loop starting from I plus one, so that I don't repeat the same value, and just testing all of them if the sum is equal to the to the target sum. Uh, I mean, that's obviously not very efficient, but that's that would be like a a way to solve it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That would work. Uh, it certainly would be time-consuming, I think, as far as optimal is concerned. So, is there any kind of example that could be a little bit faster?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes. Yeah, I think that that would be quadratic. So, better than quadratic. Uh, well, since it's sorted. So, okay, I I I guess I need to figure out when I have a number, what I'm looking for is if there's another number that sums to eight. So, so if I have a one, what I need to figure out is if there's a seven somewhere in the in the, um, array. And if that's the case, if it's sorted, then I can just do binary search. Uh, I guess if I go here and I binary search for a seven. Um, then I go here and I binary search for a six, which is the complement of that. And when I go here, I binary search for a five. And and the end I just don't do anything and so in this case I would solve it like that. Uh, so that's a bit better than quadratic, I guess. Binary search is is a log, uh, algorithm in a sorted list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Also a good answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, what if you took a look at instead of going a binary search, which is unidirectional, what if you started with a pair of numbers to begin with, and then worked your way sort of in works from there?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh, let's see. So if I, okay, let me try to bound this thing. So the, the largest possible sum, I guess, uh, would be the last two values."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That would be the largest possible sum, yes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And the smallest possible sum would be the the two smallest, right? So, so anything in between, um, ah, okay. So the range of the possible values is that, right? So there's nothing that is probably small, there's nothing that can be smaller than this value. There's nothing that can be larger than that value. Uh, that's okay. So if this sum is 10 in this case, it's too large. So I need to find a smaller sum. So I could just sort of move this one over here. And if that is too small now, then I need to move that one over there. Okay. So I can I think I can just do it with with that in a in a linear solution. Just moving at each iteration, I either move the high one lower if I am, if my pair is too large. And I move my lower higher if my pair is too small. And I end whenever I either find two, like, uh, in this case, I I either find a pair that adds up to eight, or whenever they cross. So at every at every point I'm moving one of them. So they would have to at least cross, and I move exactly one. So that means that it's linear. Yeah, so that that would be a a way of solving that problem."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And how does that how does that make that faster than a binary search?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So in the binary search case, I was doing log for finding, but I had to repeat that for every element. So that was an N log N solution. In this case, I just need to do that moving, scanning, the one time. So it's a linear solution. So that's that's faster."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right, right. Okay. So, before, maybe we could get to coding it, but before we do that, maybe you could explain, so you you explained it in a non-working example. Maybe you could follow through that same process in a working example."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Yeah. So here I would start with this and that, right? So it's five, it's smaller than eight, so I move this one here. So that's six, that's smaller than eight, so I go here and then that's eight. So that's true and I return."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Excellent. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think that would work."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So what coding language would you prefer to to do this in?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, I I prefer C++ if that's okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "C++ works. Okay. All right. Go for it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Ah, perfect. Let's see. So, okay, uh, now I realize that I haven't figured out what I need to return. So, do I want the pair, the indices of the pair, or whether I just found it or not?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, uh, for the purposes of the example, we'll go with whether you found it or not. But let's say you were going to return the pair, how could that become a problem if there was no pair?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, I mean, building the pair would be easy, right? So I I would just return the pair. If I didn't find it, then I would need to return some sort of like boolean. So I guess I could make a data structure that has a boolean that denotes whether the pair is valid or not, like has has it been found? So like a like a bull found, and then a pair, uh, values or something like that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And that ties it together. Right? Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And then this is the thing that you return. I mean, it's not very elegant, but it's workable. Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rather than going with a custom object, maybe we'll just return a boolean then."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. That that makes it a lot easier. Yes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm. Okay. So let's just call it has pair with sum, I guess. Let's, uh,"}, {"role": "user", "content": "And so I I'm okay just receiving whatever. I would like to receive it as a vector, say."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vector's fine. Yeah, sure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And we said ints are fine."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ints are fine."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh, this is my data. And then I have an int, which is my sum."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So, like I said, I want sort of an int, uh, my low, which is zero. And then my high, which is, uh, the data size minus one. And then what I'm going to do is while these are, well, while while my low is strictly lower than my high. Okay. As soon as they are touching, then I know that I can't guarantee that they're different, so that that's where I should stop. Okay? My while low is less than my high. And this also solves the problem of what happens if this is empty. Because then if this is empty, this would be a minus one. And then that would be violated, so I would never enter and access any of the value. So that that's fine. So, while low is less than high, I guess, if my data at low plus my data at high is the same as my target. Uh, my target which is called sum. Then I have found it. That's it. That's my pair. And here is where I would construct that pair if I needed to return it. But, like you say, for now I can just return true. Now, if this is larger than sum, and this is lower than sum. So, I think I'm better than just doing it three times. I'm just going to store it in a in a variable, uh, which is my S. That. And then say if S is my sum, then return true."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I'm going to stop you right there."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Excellent solution. I see what you're getting at here, but now I'm going to throw a little wrench into the mix for you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, boy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I can no longer guarantee for you that the numbers in this collection are sorted."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You have to think of a different way to to bear them against each other now."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I mean, if the first thing I do is just sort, of course, then I I solve this problem the same way, right? So that would be still an N log N solution. It would. Which would be like the same as as the the binary search as well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It would. But it's too slow for Google."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so you want faster than that. Okay. Okay, let's see. So if I go back to this idea, okay, so let me erase this. If I go back to this idea of when I look at a number, what I need to figure out is if the complement is in the rest."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The complement meaning the the yeah, the eight minus this value, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "In this case, when I have the one, I need to figure out if seven is in the rest."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "If I cannot sort and searching that will be linear, so that's not a very good idea. But maybe I can do it the other way around. So I build it up little by little, and instead of just sort of asking a blanket, is there anywhere? I just ask, have I seen it in the past? So, for instance, if I'm here, what I need to find out is if I have seen 8 minus 3. Have I seen five in the past?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That would work."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So you'd have to store five."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Or I guess it's the same, but I could be storing the complements and I just ask, have I seen three as a complement of anything of the things before? Sort of like I I I I insert a seven when I see a one."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I insert a six if I see a two."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You insert the complement."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And then, yes, I insert the complement and then when I get here, I ask, is the is this the complement of anything I have seen in the past?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, I can do, I can use a data structure that is very good for for lookups."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Right? So, I can do something like a hash table, which has like a constant time lookup. Um,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hash table though. Hash table. Do you need a key in this case?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I I guess I don't need a I mean, I just need the values, the the the the elements. I don't I don't actually want to store any payload. So, yeah, I guess a hash set would be the the thing to do. So, I hash set all of the complements and then I look for them. I I need to be careful though. Uh, how am I going to deal with the case of, uh, repeated elements? Uh, so I don't want to be able to say, oh, I have a four. Yes, of course, I have a four. I'm done. Right? I if I have this, I have a four. I'd have it, so I'm done. That would be a wrong solution. I guess I need to be careful there. So, Okay. Okay, okay. So, here's an idea. I only look for things. So, when I'm here, I only look for things that I have seen before. So, as long as I check before I insert things, that should work. And then when I add it here, this one will find that because it's in the previous one. So, I I think that works. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's good. Let's code it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Let's code it. Okay, very well. So let's see. So, like I was saying, bool of has a pair with sum, with my, oh, okay. Can I just like, uh, my vector, I mean, it's a const vector of end data. And then my int, sum. Okay. So, I need a hash set, so in C++, that's an unordered set of integers still. And I'm going to call it complements. Uh, well, I don't want to spell great complements all the time. So I'm just going to call it comp and say these are the complements. I seen whatever I need to get the target sum. And so, as I said, I just need to be building it up little by little. So I do a for, uh, my int value for each of the values in the data. I am going to first check and then insert. So, if my complement, so I check if I have seen it, first, yeah. And if I have seen it, so that means if it's not in the end, then that's it. Um, that should be a return true. Because this current element and something that I have seen in the past add up to the sum. So, obviously, depends on what I'vebeen inserting, so that's what I'm going to do here. My complements is going to be inserting I I I don't remember. I think it's add for an another set, but there's Probably. There's something. Um, it's either add or insert or something. Yeah. Yeah. So, I add not the value, but the complement, like I said. So, I do the sum minus value. I feel like I probably need to go through an example, but anyway, to make sure that this is correct. Uh, but I think that's it. Um, let me let me go through through some examples to to make sure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, so Okay. So, I have a I have a set. My my complements is a set, which starts empty. I'm going to run through both, they're kind of the same at the beginning, so that should be fine. Uh, so I have nothing in. I check for my first value, which is a one. I don't find anything, obviously. And then, uh, I add 8 minus 1. So, I add a seven here. Okay. So, now I have a seven. Um, then I go for the next one, two. I look for whether there's a two there. No, there isn't. But if I had had a six here, adding the complement would have found the two. So that would that would be good. So that that makes sense. Okay. The seven, it's not there, so I just add now the six. And here's where they start to diverge. Uh, the next case is, I get a three. Have I seen a three? No. Well, have I seen the complement of a three? No. So I just shove in the three. Uh, I I store it's complement. Good point. Yeah, and then the last one, no, I have not there's no nine here, so it would correctly return false. Now, what about the other one? The other case, I get a four. I have not seen a uh, the complement of four. So I put the four in. Because it's 8 minus 4 is 4. And then, when I get to this one, I have found it. So I correctly return true. Yeah. So the value would be four. I look here in my complements and I do find it, so I return true. Okay, so that works. Uh, what happens with an empty? Uh, the empty one should never return true because you don't have a pair, so that's fine. If you have only one thing, you never would compare again, so that's fine. So it seems like that that works. Uh, there is one issue. This could underflow. So, uh, Okay, let's not worry about that. So I think this is this is the right solution. Um, So it's linear because I am doing constant amount of work. The lookup is constant. Adding is constant for a for an unordered set, and I do it for all of the values in the input, so that's linear. And the memory is I guess linear as well because the worst case scenario I have added all of them to the set."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Would you do anything differently here if there were 10 million integers in this collection?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh, okay. So, let's see. Um, so if the input is large, does it still fit in memory or?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Probably not at this point."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So, if it doesn't fit in memory, what I can do, okay, so is the range of these values limited in some way? Um,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can assume that they might be, yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, okay, okay. So if this if my set fits in memory, but my whole input doesn't fit in memory, then I can just sort of process it in chunks, right? Uh, I chunk it and I just put it in a set and I accumulate it in a set. Uh, if we can do it in parallel, then it's kind of the same thing, right? So now you have multiple computers, each one the processing each bit of it of the input. Each one producing a, um, set of complements that this bit has seen. And we just sort of merge them. Um,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think we have enough computers available."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, so the merging would be a bit tricky because we want to make sure that again, we don't we don't sort of look for the thing that we have put in. So, uh, I guess as long as each individual computer is testing this in the right order, when we merge them, now we can say, oh, well, those two are are are correctly, um, so if I have a four in one computer and a four in the other computer, when I merge them, I would need to be careful that that I reconcile them. But other than that, I think that would be the only consideration."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great! Good job on this interview. I think that's everything today, see you next time!"}]}
