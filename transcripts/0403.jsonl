{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hey."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How are you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm great, thank you."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right, get started then."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'll begin. Okay. A company is Planning to interview 2N people. Given the array costs where cost I of A cost I B cost I. The cost of flying the I th person to city A is a cost I and the cost of flying the I th person is city B is B cost I. Okay. Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly n people arrive in each city. Okay, let's look at an example. Input costs. So there are only two cities that we can fly people to, right? A and B. Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly n people arrive in each city. So everyone arrives in either A or everyone arrives in B. So."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or not everyone arrives in A or B. Half go to A, half go to C or half go to A, half go to B."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, okay. Half go to A, half go to B. Oh, okay. Okay. So it can't be. It has to be half. Exactly."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. Because. Okay, it says there are two N people and you need to send N."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And what do I is N the length of costs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Half of it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So this is n. This is 2n. So I'm guaranteed that. The cost array will be. There will be an even number of inputs and costs. Is that correct? Correct. Exactly. Half arrive at N, half arrive at B. Okay, so basically I need to compare the cost of flight to each city for every single person. So whoops. For person one, I can see that it's cheaper to fly to A, so maybe I'll send person one to A. And then second person A is cheaper, maybe I'll send it to A. Third person B is cheaper, maybe I'll send it to B. And then fourth person D is cheaper, so maybe I'll send it there. So I think in this example it just works to pick the cheapest city, but I think that's definitely not going to apply to every example. So let's say, let's say for the third person, it's cheaper to fly A. Now we have three. Three people that have city A as the cheapest option. But we can't fly three people at city A because we need to meet the requirement of have people in every city. So I guess there's kind of a decision tree that we need to make here or some kind of backtracking algorithm where we go over each one of the persons and for each person we can either send them to A or we can send them to B. And depending on that we will, I guess we will try every. It's possible we could just try every possible combination of every person to every city while keeping the balance equal and then just compare the cost like that. But let's see what would the time complexity of that solution be? It would be we make a decision. We have two decisions to make in every. For every candidate, there are 2N candidates. So it will be two to the power of 2N. I believe that's kind of slow. So maybe I'll think of a better way or a more efficient way to decide which, which person goes to where. Okay, let's think about it this way. Perhaps we could rank the costs so that the cheapest costs get selected first and then the more expensive flights. Get selected later. So like for example, so right now the cost applying City A is 1030. 1030. Maybe we could sort that to 1030, 30 and then just pick these. Well, we're going to run into issues again because it's not always guaranteed that we can fly the same group of people to different cities. They might overlap. We need to consider that. Okay, let's, let's see. What about, what if. Okay. I'm trying to think about whether or not I need to do some pre processing to the cost array. Like do I need to sort it by, by any, any way or should I just iterate through each one of these and figure it out as I go? I'm trying to think whether or not sorting it is going to sorting by A or sorting by B is going to help me in any way. Let's think. So if I sort it, what would I sort it by? I'll sort it by. Well, there's two cities, so I can't really decide on just one. Maybe I'll sort the cost of both cities, but how would I keep track of what cost belongs to what person? That's kind of a issue as well. So I think I probably won't try to sort the input array by any way. I think, I think the way to do it is we'll just iterate through the cost array and figure it out as we go. Maybe there's some sort of memorization we could, we can do, but I don't, I don't see it just yet."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think backtracking with memorization is definitely a way to do it, but I think we can try for something more efficient."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why don't we take a step back too? So like, I think right now we're kind of in the weeds of the code, how the code might look like. But I guess like if you were at a human, like how would you know, like which person should go here or there? Like looking at example one."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's certain individuals that should go to like a certain city. Like, like glaringly that you realize instantly, like. Oh, they should go here because of this and that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, so I see. Person one and three should definitely go to city A because they are the cheapest and. But I also have to consider that the second person should definitely not go to city B because it's going to be super expensive. So if I send person one to city A and person three to city A, that I'm going to have to send Person 2 to City B because that's how I've met the limit. And that's kind of bad because if I send person B, sorry, it's the second person, the city B, then the cost would be huge. So I guess I have to decide between who should definitely go to a city and who should definitely not go to a city."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why don't you send person 2 to city A first?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, so I'll send person A. Sorry, second person to city A, and then that's done. And then who else should go to city A? It should be. I think it should be person, person number one. So one and two goes to A."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why do you say it's one?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because I'm deciding between one and three and looking at one and three because. Oh, sorry. I think I meant to say I should send person three to City A because if I send person one to City A, then person three has to send. Has to use the $50 cost, which is a lot. But if I send two and three to City A, then I only have to send the person one to city B and that'll only cost 20 bucks, which is less than 50, and then I'll have to send person four is city A, which would be 30 bucks. And. Okay, let's see if that's. Is that the right solution? So 30 plus 10, that's city A, and then that'll be 20 plus 30 plus city B. So that's 50. That'd be 40. Okay, but that doesn't really match with the output. Wait, no. Okay, I send person to city."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think you modified the input. That's why."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, oh, sorry. Yeah, I remember now."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The original is 450."}, {"role": "user", "content": "300. Okay. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or 400. Oh, yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So look at. Looking at it like this, I can definitely know that Person two should definitely not go to city B. This person should definitely not go to city the A. So that only leaves. Well, who's you going to see the. Hey, that's. That only leaves these three people. And of the three people, this guy is the cheapest. But do I. Do I want to send him to city A for sure though?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I guess why don't we take a step further back too? Like why we. Look, why are your eyes instantly drawn to the second or third person first?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because their costs are so high. Like, they are significantly higher than the average."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or what about if the costs were also like 400 and 401 for which person? Or just say there's an extra person or. Sorry, I. I guess, like, if you had an input like 400 and 401, like, would your eyes still be drawn to this?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No. Oh, why is that looking at the difference? I. I think the key is in the difference. Because the reason why I'm drawn to this is, is because I know that it's going to be way cheaper to send this person to city A. Because if I send this to this person to city B, I'm going to be paying so much more because the difference is 170, right? I have to pay $170 more. Not the fact that it's 200, because if I have 400 with 401, then it doesn't really matter where I send him to because it's going to be expensive anyways. The cost to either one of the Cities is just $1. So although I'm gonna. Although I'm trying to get the minimum cost, I'm gonna have to pay a lot for this person anyways. So I shouldn't be too caught up by the fact that, you know, I have 400 big number. Right? I should be looking at the difference. So maybe what I'll do is I'll try to look at the difference and say I'll just do A minus B. That's how I calculate the difference. And so person one would have difference of negative 10. That would be negative 170. This person would have 350. This person would have 10. Okay. So, okay, now that I have the difference, I get a positive and a negative number. And I think that could help me decide which city each, each of these people should go to. Okay, so if I have a negative difference, that means it's cheaper to send them to A compared to B. So maybe I should just send them to A. And if I have a positive difference, that means it's cheaper to go to B compared to A. So I should send them to B. Okay, so what would example 1 output B. I would send this person to B. That would be 20 bucks. This person goes to B. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. It should go. They should go to A. 10 plus 30 plus A is 40. This person should definitely go to B. So that's 50 bucks plus 20 bucks equals 70. So 40 plus 70, that's 1 100. Okay, so now let's try this example. Difference is."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, feel free to use a calculator."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, you see the calculator."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so yeah, whatever calculator you want to use."}, {"role": "user", "content": "2, 2, 5, 9 minus 77511 negative. Yeah, I mean I could just approximate, you know, maybe it's just 400 something. Yeah, it's a negative 3, 340 something. Maybe positive, positive 40 something. This is going to be 8, 700 something. And this is going to be 100 something. Okay. Okay, so I guess I can sort this. Right, but sorted, there'll be negative 5, 1, 1, then 340. 340. The next one is 40. Okay, and then the next person is 100, 400, 700. Then I can split this in half. Right? So I'll say maybe these people, they go to. Hey, and these people, they got a B. And okay, let's see if this thinking works. So 511, that's person A. Person A goes to city A. That's 259 plus second person, negative 340. That's this person. If I send them. To. Whoops. Positive. My bad. 40 positive. Yes, positive. Okay, so 40. 40 person is. This person is 1 and 4. Okay, then I'll go next person. 100. 100 is this person. City A is 577. Let's try to calculate this. 2, 5, 9 plus 14 plus 5 sub 7 make one. Okay, let's do B. So it's these guys. 340. 340. This person. 666-67-400. This guy is 54 plus. Okay, what about 718? 67 plus 54 plus 118839 plus 10 21. 859185 9. Okay, so it works for this one. So it seems like. Okay, let's see if. Let's see if it holds up for the third example."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I don't think we need to do that. I think your approach is correct. Why don't we start coding?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "All right, so again. But I'll keep it simple. Calculate difference for each person, sort and send first half to A, second half to B. Extra cost, total cost. Okay, so this approach would be O because I know I have to sort sort the difference for the other parts. I'm just iterating through the array once and two times o n log n 2n approximately. Okay. I do believe this approach is a lot more optimal than the backtracking approach. So I'm going to begin working on the solution. I'll say class name. And so I'm returning the cost, which is an integer. Okay. Static gets total cost. And I'll say the input is just a single 2D array. So it's int missing a t."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What's that for int here? Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Then let me just write the main methods. Okay, so all right, let's calculate the difference for each person and we will keep track of it in an integer array. So let's just say int difference equals variance. That should be equal to the length, the length of this in costs. Okay. And I'm going to iterate through costs. I'll say current difference equals cost of I of It's A minus B. So it should be. The first one should be zero minus cos I of one and then that goes into the difference array which is difference. I will do words current difference. Okay, then we need to sort. So can I just. The built in method for sort."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, you can do that. Question. So when you sort by the differences, how do you know which person this corresponds to?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Ah, okay. I need to keep track. Okay. I can keep track of that with a map."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What if, what if there's the same difference though?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, what if there's. Yeah, that's a good question. So okay, let's think about this. It definitely needs to map something, but what do I map it to? By. Well, the key has to be unique and the only thing that seems to be unique."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Do we need to use a map? Like why can't we use the difference array?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Store some additional information in your different."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, perhaps I could. I can. Well, can I make this a 2D array and then store the index of costs in here. But when I sort it, it's not gonna. It's not gonna stick. It's gonna be scrambled. So maybe there's a different way. Let's think about."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What about some other down types?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, let's see. Oh, I can use an array list where I can use an array. List of integer arrays and then. Yes, okay, but I need to figure out how to model. How to override the sort method to sort by, you know, the first element in the array."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So look that up."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I'll just. I'll say of ints equals to. So let's make a new. Just delete this and host away introduction. Let's say currents of view is equal to 1. I keep track of the index, so I know who's who. Okay. And after that I need to sort it. So yeah, I need it. I need to look that up, but complete the rest of the code first. So let's just say I got the sorted version of. Let's just say I got it. What would happen if I got it? So I would need to make. I need to int for the cost equals zero and I'll do iterate through the arraylist. Hence I equals 0, I less than size person goes to the cost difference in the person number of the current person. Then I can figure out what the cost is to send that person to each city. So how do I know when to send a person A if I'm in the first half? Okay, so if, if I is less than difference size over 2 less than or less than equal. Okay, let's see. For this example there's six people. That means I'm going from index zero to five. So from 012 it's good. From 345 it's going to be. So I need six divided by three is, I'm sorry, two is three so I'll say yes, it's less than, not less than, equal to. So I'm sending these people to A. So I would get the person index equal to first of the one as the index and I would say cost is plus equal to costs of person index and I'm sending them to city A. So I'm getting the first elements which is zero. Okay, basically the same for second half except I need to get the second one which is city B. And after that I return over the cost. Okay, so now let's work on the sort part. Can I go on a different site to search?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, that's fine."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I need to make a class of herder that extends the interface. I go collections, dot sort and use stock comparator. Okay, so let's see. I'll say that's a type of. Type of integer and so public. Public and comp. Sorting in the increasing order. So."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, you can just copy and paste it over and then modify it to your needs."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Having to switch between the tabs."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So I'll say, how do they use it? Collections Sort. So a sort. Install it. All right. So guess I'll just run it. Let's say int Records. List also needs to be imported, cannot be referenced from static content. Then there's a typo here not be referenced from a static context. Okay, well, if I. If I make this method non static, then I can't reference it here because it's not static. This is tricky. I make the clothic. This is meaning, right? Program looks at it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not sure. Okay. It looks like it ran because you are returning something though. Or you can try putting a print statement."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so there's probably. Let's see, let's see. Why."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So we are at time. But I'll let you. I'll give you a couple extra minutes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, sure. Finding footprints."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's more so what you're sort. What are you sorting?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, no. Like what? Are you populating difference correctly?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm not. Forgot to populate difference. It's not cool. Okay, let's try another one, I think."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, yeah, we can run the last one, but I think looks good to me. It."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, all right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, I think that is. Did we copy the bottom part too?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think I'll increase it though. Or I'm not sure. Maybe I'll decrease it just because of the savings."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Nope. Okay. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. I guess we already went over time and space. Yeah, I don't really have anything to say. I think overall you did a pretty good job. I guess some things I would like to remind you is like. Oh, we should like, try to. Try to think about like as a human first before."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Straight into like sorting. It might help with your. Your brainstorming. Let's see. I think otherwise, the only other thing I have that stood out to me was right here. I think we can name it a little better instead of current. Like current double or something other than current or something. Yeah. Otherwise I don't have anything. I can go over the rubric."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wait, I think I forgot the question. Wait, would you say that I. Because I think I didn't really come up with the solution myself this time. You have to hit me towards the difference."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I mean, I didn't tell you explicitly. That is the difference. I'm just telling. Telling you, like, oh, how do you know? Like, I, I guess. What do you. What is your question? Sorry."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, because you. Because I was like, focusing on the, the backtracking solution, but then you told me to. To look at it a different way. So does that count as, like, a hint?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I mean, I think it counts as a hint, but, like, it's not a bad thing to receive a hint, right? I think, like, my hint is pretty general."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think because according to the school videos monster, if they give you a hint, you're basically cooked."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, I don't know about that. I think, like, there's different types of hints, right? Like, I think mine's a little more of a nudge and like, very general. I think when I told you, like, oh, you should sort by the differences, I don't think that's as like, great of a hint. Yeah, like, in terms like, that means you definitely don't are way off track. I think you're like. I think like, the way I like giving hints and I hope most interviewers do the same, is like you kind of slowly nudge the person in the right direction or the direction that the interviewer thinks is correct. And like, if you don't see the first hint, then I'll start adding more details to my hints. But I think your was very general and you're able to piece it"}, {"role": "user", "content": "if, if you were talking a lot with your approach and then your interviewer thinks that it's not in the right direction and they like, nudge you back in the right direction. That doesn't really count as too much of a hint."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I mean, I think it's like, subjective for the interviewer. I don't think this hint I gave you is like, reveals too much. Okay. Yeah, I guess, like, I wouldn't be too down if, oh, I received a hint. I'm doomed. I think, like, I think it's like, again, like, it's a collaborative experience. I think it should be more holistic. Right? Like, are you working together with the interviewer? Like, if I give you a hint and you start working like, like, let's say, like, I give you a hint and you completely discarded it and continue with your backtracking thing, then. Then it might be a little bit more concerning. Right. But the fact that you used the hint and took off and found the solution with it, and I didn't need to give you any more detailed hints, I think that's pretty good in my books already. And I, I think everything else in your coding was very smooth. I think you looking up things is fine. I think Java, I don't know. I personally stay away from Java. When I'm coding, I use Python so I don't have to deal with the fancy extra classes and public static stuff. But I think that's fine. It's fine to look things up. I think everything else, you execute it perfectly fine. Yeah. I mean, you debugged, you created your approach, and then you took off with the hint. So I think, like, I would pass you if this was an actual interview. I don't think a hint is like, means you're doomed or cooked or whatever. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Also said that if you ever go to geeks and geeks, you're cooked. If you copy any documentation, you're cooked."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I mean, I think it's like, the degree of it, like, If like, say like I think for you, right, you had a comparator class, right. Or you didn't know how to do it. Right. You knew the general idea of what you wanted, right. And then looked it up. Right. That's perfectly fine. I think if you were to look up something more general, say how do I write bfs? I think that's something you should know. Right. If you look that up and copy it over, I think that's a huge red flag. Right. But the fact that I think what I'm getting at is when you look something up, you should have an expectation of what you are trying to do. I guess, for example, if I were. Got dark in here, if you were to look up how to find how many occurrences are there for each character in a string, yes, you can do that manually. But I know in Python there's a fancy dictionary that I can import and it does it for me and see, I forgot how to import that fancy dictionary, Right. But I would tell the interviewer I know I can do this manually and I'll do it this and that way. But for conciseness, can I look this up? Like you have an expectation of what you're trying to find right now. In contrast, the other part is like what you should not be doing is like, oh, I don't know how to write bfs, let me look it up and copy it over or things like that. I think if you don't have any idea what you're looking for and you just happen to find the solution online and then copy it over, that's a huge red flag. But I think what you're doing is fine. Right? You have an expectation of what you are looking for and then you go find it and then use that? Yeah, I mean I think you did try to use the documentation. I don't think from what I read it was very useful either. So you tried another source and you stayed away from the AI generated stuff, which is fine too. Yeah, I think the way you approached looking it up was reasonable and nothing to be concerned about."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks for pointing it out."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, so I guess like, I think Aman's advice is like still something, still useful. But I think he's talking about the more like severe, like there's like a spectrum to like how much, how many hints or like what you're looking up online. I think he's more so addressing like the, the, the end of the spectrum."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, but would in an interview would they ever like give you a pretty obvious hint? Like if you really can't if you're, like, 25 minutes into it and you still have no idea. Like, would they just. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I mean, they could. I think it's dependent on the interviewer. I mean, like, sometimes if you're not. Like, sometimes, even if you're close, they might tell you the hint right away, or sometimes you're very far off, then tell you. I think it's up to the interviewer, but at least for me, I like to gently nudge you in the right direction. If you don't see it, then I'll start adding more details. But I also want to give, like, you enough time for you to, like, what happens if I said, A hint too early and then you realize and you would have came to that thought process eventually. Like, I don't think that's good either. So I usually let you, like, think for a little bit before giving a hint, but I guess, like, what the interviewer says and how they say it is, like, very, like, random, Right. If you might get a bad interviewer, you might get a good interviewer, but I wouldn't let that, like, stress you out too much. I think it's like, there are definitely things that you can control, right? Like how you incorporate their feedback and the way you brainstorm. And like, I think, like, for you, right. Like, I think you are very good at sharing your thoughts. And you go. Even if you go down, like, other paths that might not work or might not be as optimal, you call them out, which is very good. Right. Like, holistically, that is a big, strong engineer, and that's what you should be going for rather than like, oh, am I going to, like, get a bad hint or something like that. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. I hope that answers your question.

I'd never seen something like this, so I was like, oh, maybe I'll try backtracking. And then I realized, oh, like, something like, screams out, like, how do I know, like, this is. My eyes are listening. Drawn to this for some reason. Right? Yeah.

Do you want me to go over this or."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I guess. Well, you said that I did most of it pretty well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, I mean, I think everything pretty well. I don't have anything, like, I think from the past interviews, right. We've kind of, like, improved everything. Every time, like, you read the problem and you start calling out the edge cases. I think I really liked how you, like, read this and, like, was like, oh, this. Your original approach was like, oh, this happened to be just work out because, like, half are negative, half are positive. What if you tried some other number here like, or something like that. I think, like, that's good. And then, then you went into brainstorming and created your code. And then when you're creating your code, you implement it like what you did know. And then when you asked to look something up, you kind of had an expectation of what you're going for. And yeah, I mean, time complexity, space complexity, caught it early in the beginning. I mean, I guess the only thing from now the only things we can do is, like, continue to practice and, like, increase our speed and efficiency. But in terms. Execution, I think I have no comments."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Thanks for your time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, no problem. Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about or questions you want?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Me? Oh, I do have a question. So in the, in my past job searching process, I have gotten a couple of online assessments. What I wanted to ask is that do they just give out online assessments to every single person who applied or only people who pass the resume screen?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's a mix of the two options that you presented."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some might be automated, some might be like a little bit of some screen before you get it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And for the online assessments, is it like, if you don't ask every single question, like basically get 100%, do you. Is it still possible to continue to the next stage or is it just. Yeah, you're cooked?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's definitely possible. Still. I think, I think it depends on the company. Some companies might be. Some companies might be very competitive. So a higher score might help you. But I don't know if they only just look at your score. I've definitely seen on like online forums where someone like bombs their oa, but then they still make it through because their experience is very good. Yeah, go ahead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because usually what I get is I get like, I get the three questions and then I get stuck on the fourth. I just run out of time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like, is this code signal?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, closing though basically the third problems, usually a medium. The first two is like easy, but then I, I run out of time and I don't get to the fourth. So."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you need to pass everything, but I think for code signal it's particularly tricky. Like one and two are like giving. Give you like three points, right? And then three is what, like some kind of brute force solution? And then four is like, relies on some tricky optimization, I think, to solve those. That just comes with practice. But I think in terms of like moving on to the next round, like, I don't think passing the OA is indicative of like, whether you make it to the next round or not. And yeah, I also guess like that Also another thing is like, if you apply early, you also have a better chance of moving on, right? Because the spots are. There are more spots open still."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And also for basically every OA I got, they told me to like open my camera and my mic. Do they ever check the recordings?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think so. I know for code signal they do. I know for code signal, I think one time I got flagged, I think I like stood up and closed the window so they saw me, like, leave my camera. So I'm not too sure what happened there. But, yeah, they do check it. I know. For code signal. They definitely do."}, {"role": "user", "content": "There was one time where I got my first ever oa and I was like. And they told me to turn on my mic and camera and I started just talking aloud. I thought they would be watching, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I think it's only to detect if you're cheating. Cheating or not. Unless the thing specifically asks for you to, like, explain what you're doing live. I wouldn't be too worried about, like, explaining what's going on."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, thanks for clarifying."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I mean, I think it's on the instructions, so whatever you might end up doing an OA on."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Yeah. That's basically all my questions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. All right, nice talking to you again. Hopefully I can do another mock with you soon. Have a good day. Feel free to quit the interview when you're ready."}]}
