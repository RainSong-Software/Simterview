In other words, Strobogrammatic Number appears the same right-side up and upside down.\n\n0 after 180° rotation : (0 → 0)\n1 after 180° rotation : (1 → 1)\n8 after 180° rotation : (8 → 8)\n6 after 180° rotation : (6 → 9)\n9 after 180° rotation : (9 → 6)\n\n\nExamples :\n\nInput : n = 2\nOutput : 88  11  96  69\n\n\nInput : n = 4\nOutput : 8008 1001 9006 6009 8888 1881 9886 6889 8118 1111\n        9116 6119 8968 1961 9966 6969 8698 1691 9696 6699\n\nINTUITION:\nTo determine if a number is strobogrammatic, we can map each digit to its corresponding digit when flipped 180 degrees. We initialize a list, d, where the index corresponds to a digit and the value at that index corresponds to what the digit would look like after being flipped 180 degrees. In the list d, a value of -1 means the digit does not form a valid number when flipped (these are the numbers that cannot contribute to a strobogrammatic number).\n\nA strobogrammatic number should be symmetrical around its center. Therefore, we only need to compare the first half of the string to the second half. We set up two pointers, i starting at the beginning of the string and j at the end, and move them towards the center. At each step we:\n\nConvert the digits at indices i and j to integers a and b.\nCheck whether the strobogrammatic counterpart of a is equal to b. If it's not, we immediately return false since the number is not strobogrammatic.\nMove the pointers inward, i going up and j going down.\nIf we successfully traverse the string without mismatches, then the number is strobogrammatic and we return true.\n\nThe solution is elegant because it only requires a single pass, giving us an efficient way to solve the problem with O(n) complexity, where n is the length of the string num.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hey, what's up?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hey, how are you doing?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good, good. All right. So is this your first mock interview? Right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes. First one."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Have you done a mock technical interview before?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so Basically this is 45 minutes, 40 minutes of which we'll be coding, and then 5 minutes, I'll give you feedback at the end. 40 minutes is a little shorter than usual for, like, a normal coding interview. Usually they're 45 minutes to 60 minutes, but again, this is just to make sure you have the general procedure down of how to approach technical interview. Yeah. So why don't you read the problem description on your left. You can write your solution in the code editor on the right. I can see the code that you write in real time. Do you have a preferred programming language?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, it's Java."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The question is already there, so you can get started. The timer is already on."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Let's read the question. Given a string num, which appears, which represents an integer turn. True. If num is a strobe. Strobo gram. Strobo grammatic number. Strobo grammatic number is a number that looks the Same when rotated 180 degrees. Looked at upside down. Example 669. You rotate it. Okay. Also 69, 8, 9, 6 2. False. Okay, so when I'm first thinking about this problem is that there are special numbers between 1 and 9 that can achieve this special property of being strobo grammatic. Right. So like 6 or 9, when you flip it upside down, they 6 flip upside down looks like 9, and 9 flip off. Like down looks like 6. 8 is the same whether you flip it or not. And the two, you can't really flip it because if you flip it, it doesn't look like any number. So let me think of whether or not there's other numbers that have this property. So can one be flipped upside down?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. Let's say one is just like the vertical. Like a vertical line."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. It's. So it's not like the one with the."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's just like this actually line."}, {"role": "user", "content": "We have 1, 2. Not valid. 3. No, because it would look like an e."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "No. 3, 4. Probably not. 5. 5. Nope. Because it looks like an S. 6. And then we have 7. Nope. 8. And then 9. Yep. And then 0. Yes. Okay, nice. Okay, so we have 1. Sorry. 0, 1, 6, 8, 9. And I'm noticing that some of these numbers, when you flip them upside down, they stay the same. So 018. When you flip them upside down, they stay 018. But if you flip 6, it becomes 9. If you flip 9, it becomes 6. So we need to be aware of how these numbers look when they flip upside down, specifically, being careful with the sixes and the nines. Because If I think 69 works. Because when you flip it upside down, the 9. Because you read it backwards. Right. If you flip it upside down."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, Sorry."}, {"role": "user", "content": "When you flip. Flip it, is it like this or is it like this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The first way."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The first way. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. So 180 degrees."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So as if, like, as if you flipped your monitor around and, like, was reading it that way. Yeah, yeah. So I."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So technically, I will be reading 96, but because it's flipped upside down, it becomes 69. Is that correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Are you saying 96 as a different example?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No, for the first number, if I flip it, I will be reading. Technically I'll be reading the nine first and then the."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because it's flipped, it becomes 69."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And by the way, can I get negative numbers in this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's say no for the prompt."}, {"role": "user", "content": "All right, so what I need to be careful of, if I have 66 as an another example and I flip it upside down, that it wouldn't actually be a valid answer because it would turn to 99. Right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Correct."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So. And I'm getting the input as a string, not as an integer. Okay. So what I think I'm going to do is I'm going to iterate through the string once and check every single character and determine whether or not it will be valid if it's rotated 180 degrees. So first of all, I would check if. If it's a 0, 1, 6, 8, 9, if it's like a 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, then I would assume that the input is automatically false because there's no way that any of those numbers turned upside down could be a valid number. Is that correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, that's correct."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. And then I would need to consider that. Okay, it should also be a. Palindrome, technically, if it's flipped upside down because the orders of every number are reversed, right? So, for example, it would need to be something like 01, 6, 1 0, I flip this upside down. Or no, that wouldn't be valid because the 6 becomes a 9, then it becomes a different number, and then so this would be valid. 0, 1, 8, 1, 0. Okay, so basically what I need to do is maybe what I could do is I could iterate through the string once, the input string once, and create the string that. With the string that would be flipped 180 degrees, if you look at it that way. So, like, If I have 110810 as the input, I would go ahead and flip the number to be 1 8, 10 and then compare the two strings after to check whether or not they are the same string. If they are the same, then that means I can. It's a valid number. Like, for example, if I have six here, then flip it upside down and become nine. Then these two numbers wouldn't be the same, and so it's not valid. Okay, but what if I have, say, 6, 6, 9, 9? Then this, this number would not be valid because if you flip it, then the six would become nines and it becomes a different number. Is that a correct assumption?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I guess. One question. Like, what about. Like, what about for the example, 69? Like, I understand that you're creating, like, a new output, right? Like, how can you elaborate on that final part when you're comparing the two numbers that you create?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so I would convert. I would convert every single one of these numbers to their equivalent if they're flipped 180 degrees, because, okay, so six, when you flip it upside down, becomes nine. Yeah, we flip it upside down becomes six. Okay? Oh, then that. This input is true. But if I compare them like this, it would be false. So this approach is not valid. Okay, let me think about why it's not valid. Because. Okay. Because if you have. Because sixes and nines become different numbers when you. Yeah. Okay. So I guess what I'm trying to compare is. Okay, maybe if I compare. So, like, going back to this one, if I go over and compare the two numbers, I start with the first digit and compare it to the last digit of this one. And if I apply that thinking to the first example, I would compare the six to the last digit, which is also six, and I'll compare nine to the first digit. So, like, one will be going forward, one will be going backwards. Nothing. That would be a better solution. Correct."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So what I'm understanding is you're mapping things to their rotation and then checking the newly created string backwards and comparing that to the original."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That makes sense to me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This. This would require O N space since I'm creating another string and it would run in, sorry, linear time because I'm iterating the string twice. Once to convert, once to check."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Makes sense to me."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Do you think I should implement the solution right now, or do you want me to come up with a solution with better memory complexity or maybe even time complexity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think that sounds optimal to me. Why don't we go ahead and start coding?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So we have. And I can name the method anything."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, whatever you think is the best fit."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So the first thing I need to do is I need to create a map of these numbers and. Well, maybe I don't. Perhaps I could just use IF statements to check. Would you like me to have a map or do you want me to just use IF statements to convert the numbers to their flipped equivalent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think you should use a map. I think that's cleaner."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so let's say hash. Now, inverse equals new. This is going to store invalid numbers that can be flipped. And. Okay. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to populate the map. Populate, map. And then after I populate the map, I would iterate or no. First of all, I would create a string that would be the flipped equivalent of the first string. And then I would iterate through the original string and create the flip string one character at a time. Okay. Then after I create the flipped string, I would need to compare to see whether or not the two strings are valid. And I need to use an approach where I compare the first string to the last second string to the second last. Like that. So I would use another. For loop. For loop and check."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, for. Sorry to interrupt. For line 30 and 31. Are those the same steps or are those two different steps?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is to initialize them. The variable."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, I see. I see. My bad. Sorry."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I didn't make it clear. For a loop to check the flip string to see if it is equal to the input. They're in reverse order. Okay. And then I. I just return true or false from here. Return results. How much time do I have left?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "About like 20 minutes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, cool. Okay, let's populate them. Dot put as I just manually put them. The 0. 0 goes to 0 because 0 flip upside down is also 0. Next is 1. 1 flipped upside down is also 1. 6 flip upside down is 9. 8 flipped upside down is 8. And 9 flipped upside down is 6. 0, 1, 6, 8, 9. Okay, good. Now let's create the flip screen flip. Because I should use a string because it's faster equals use builder. Okay. Because I'll be continuously adding characters to the flip string. And so if I use a string, then I will need to recreate the string every single time I put a new character. And so I think a string builder will be more efficient. So let's iterate through the original string. 4. I can say RC for S. So I'm basically getting every single character in the string S, which is the input. And so for each character I would say char flip flip. Char is equal to number flips C. This is basically getting the flip revival of the current top. For example, six goes to. Okay, next we need to add the flipped character to the string builder to build the flip string. So let's say flipped and it is the flipped chart index. Yeah, I'm not too sure about the syntax here. Maybe I'll go back to check the documentation after I completed the solution. Is that okay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, you can do it now too, if you want. Whichever works for you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, I think I'll come back to this. I think this is probably correct, but. Okay. After we created the flip string, so we have the original string and then we have the flip string, we need to compare the two from reverse order. So we will have a for loop for I equals 0i less than s dot length while I press plus. So again we need to compare the first character to the last second to the second last. So we need to say if statement if. If the original strings character at index I is not equals to flip. Oh, sorry, I should. Before I do that, let's say equals flip."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, I think you have a typo on 44. I think it's flipped instead of slipped other side of the equal sign. So if."}, {"role": "user", "content": "All right, flip flex R x I minus S dot length. Let's see if that's correct. No, it should be S dot length minus I is I. Check this. So let's say I'm checking the first string where I 0 and then I would be checking the length. Like let's take this example. Length is 5. So 5 minus 0 is at index 501234. I think I will go out of bounds on that one. So yeah. What about checking the last character of the original string? Let's say I is equal to 4 and I'll be checking. Index1 and that's not correct. So I need to add a minus one here. Okay, so if they're not equal, then that means the flip number is different. And so we should immediately return false in this situation. So we do that for every single character and if the for loop manages to iterate, finish iterating without triggering this condition, and that means the strings must be equals. So in that case I'll return true. Let me look over this code one more time. I think I missed something here where I forgot to check whether or not it's the current character is one of these numbers. So I would say the way I would check is if number get c is null. Here we check for valid numbers. So let's say we get like a two, right? A two. If we try to get the number two in hashmap, it's going to return null because there's no mapping the two. And so if we get an invalid number, then we should immediately return false because there's no way that a invalid number can have a valid flip solution. So I think I forgot that in my first time implementing this. So we check for invalid numbers, get the flip version, and then we append the flipped char equivalent to the string builder. Then after that we go over the string, we check the first and the last. If they're not equal, then the string is not valid. Then return false. Also return true. Okay, so let me check the Java documentation for the syntax builder builder. Append. I'm doing a char and an integer char, char, char. I guess I could just append with the chart and then it will automatically go to the last index. So I assumed that should just be this. Okay, I believe this implementation is looks good to me. Should I manually run test cases or do I click run?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think since we can't we have the run feature available. Let's like run the test cases."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Yeah, let's do. Let's say solve. Let's use an example. Let's use 69. Okay. Click run."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, your input is a string."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Ah, sorry, I made a mistake here. Should be s proper counts chocs yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or your input at line 59 should be a string."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Line 59. What's that?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So you're passing in an integer 69 whereas the input is a string."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Not find simple hashmap I need to import it. See, I believe it's just Java input. Java util hashmap Strange. Is it because of an original group?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it let me try it as well. Something to do with your import since there's no semicolon. Or like your import was correct originally. It just needs a semicolon Afterwards. I ran it on my side."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Did it work on your side?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. Or you need a semicolon here. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Thank you. And then maybe try again. Is there any way to abort my run?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You could refresh the page. It should still keep your code. Yeah. Oh, sorry."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It. Let's do this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not sure why it takes so long to run either. It runs pretty instantly on my end. I can try running it for you if you want. This cannot find our load Main class main Caused by Java LAN Class not found exception main I think you need to capitalize main. Yeah. At least that's what the error output I'm getting is. Let me try again. Although I do think sharepad might be down."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not sure because I'm not seeing like, your cursor anymore or anything like that, even though we're technically collaborating. But yeah, I think overall it looks correct to me. If you want, we can dry run instead, just so that you're able to practice dry running or running your code. It's up to you. I think I already like the code looks correct to me. If you want, we can jump straight to feedback."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Let's go to feedback."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. And then in future interviews, we can practice dry run and going through the run just because today is not working for some reason. Yeah. But also, depending on the type of interview you're doing, sometimes you're able to do a dry run. Sometimes you're only allowed to do like a, like, running through the ide. But we can practice both in our, like, later interviews. But yeah, let me go into feedback. I think overall, I think this is a very strong performance. I think it's a very strong baseline. Like, you can only go up from here. See, where's my. There it is. Okay. Have you seen this rubric before?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so this is basically like the steps you should have included in every single technical interview that you do. Yeah. So I also took some notes on my iPad, I guess, before I start. I think one note that. Or one thing that's just like a small thing. I think you should keep track of your own time as well. Like, Yes, I can also, I can answer, like, and give you, like, how much time you have left. But I think it's also good to keep track of time on your own end just to. So that in case the problem is tricky, you can also manage like, oh, I should speed up. Or not, like. Okay, yeah, just. Just a suggestion."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What about for in persons?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like, in person, like, when you're. Oh, like, if you shut up."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In person for interview, do they have a clock or."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've not done an in person interview. Personally, I think they're quite rare. But I think, like, you could set a stopwatch or whatever works for you, like, or like wear a watch or something. I think it's just so that you know to manage your own time. Because, like, ideally in like an interview, right, you want to get through everything. You want to get through your brainstorm coding it out and then testing your code. Right. Yeah. So, yeah, I'll start with this. Any other questions about the time, though?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. But I think that's only a very small thing. I think it's just for. If the problem's trickier. But I think you are pretty strong at this based on what you'veshown today. Understand the problem. I think you were quick to read the problem. Understand the problem. And like, I liked how you walked through, walked through an example to show that you are on the same page. And personally I like calling out edge cases right after understanding problem, which is exactly what you did. You asked if it was negative, things like that. I think another question you could ask about inputs is not only about like negative numbers or I think other things you can ask like, oh, will it be empty? Or like if I think for this example, right, Will it ever like be like some too large of a value or something like that? Anything like that. But I think overall this is pretty strong solution brainstorming. I think your thought process was very well thought out and you explain your thoughts very well. So I think you were not ever silent, which is a good thing, right? You want to start talking right away just so that if you struggle, the interviewer can jump in and if the interviewer has any input, they can go ahead and say it rather than waiting on you to speak. So good job on this coding implementation. I think you're pretty quick. Again, it's also perfectly fine to look things up. Just ask the interviewer. Also, I think it's important that you look up documentation rather than put in ChatGPT or something like that. It shows that you are able to read technical writing, which is something that you will do in the workplace. I think coding overall, I think it's very clean. I would say that some variables could be renamed better. Like for example, like s string S. Like your input is like a num and whatnot. But that's a small thing, right? And I think the comments might be a little overkill. I think it's like, for these, I think at first, before you started coding, right, you only wrote the function and when you started coding, you were like writing out your steps in the comments. I think that's fine. It helps you remind yourself what to do, right? But I think like, I think like steps like these, like these comments here are a little overkill. I think like the code already, the code already shows that you're doing this. Like, I think one thing that I follow is like good production code, like, good code does not need comments. Like if your variables are named correctly and like your variables themselves should kind of hint at like what it's doing, right? If they're named. Good enough. So I think like the comments in the beginning, the outline steps are probably sufficient. Unless your code is like pretty intricate. Then you can add a comment here and there. But I don't think we need a comment for every line. I think any, like coder should kind of follow your logic. And like, also you're talking aloud. Like, when you're writing the. Like when you're writing the comment, you're kind of like repeating what you just said aloud, which is. Isn't really necessary. If there's a lot more code to write, you would be using a lot of time writing comments, right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So that's just my suggestion. I think it's good to write comments, but I think maybe we can tone it down a little. I think this is pretty strong as well. You broke down the. Problem you caught out edge cases. I think the, the example test case that I gave are pretty simple, so I think you came up with extra ones. That's good communication. Like I already touched earlier, you were explain your thoughts throughout the entire interview, which is good time and space. I actually call this out in the beginning and then you asked if. Oh, actually one thing about this. So I remember like when, when you mentioned time and space complexity, you said it correctly. And then when you ask to code, you ask like, oh, should I start coding or is there a more optimal solution? I think there's a better way to rephrase that. I think more so the latter part of that question, like, yes, you are allowed to code, but I think if it is the optimal solution, I think you should instead flip the question around so that it's worded more. So like, I believe that this is the optimal solution because of this and that, like you see how like that type of question, it shows that you're more confident and you are also providing like a justification. I think adding your line of reasoning shows that you know what you're thinking and doing. Right? Like, yeah, in this technical interview you should be in the driver's seat. So you're calling the shots, handling the trade offs and making decisions. And I think phrasing the question in that manner shows and emphasizes those like, traits. Right? Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And then this, I think there wasn't, I don't think there's anything to optimize on the code. But when you finish coding, you should always revisit this. Like take a moment, like 30 seconds just to take a glance over. In addition to like looking for syntax errors and whatnot. I think like I mentioned earlier, handling education, testing, I think you're calling this out when you're brainstorming, which is good. Right. You want to call out the edge cases early on in case it shapes or breaks your code. Right. You don't want to find out later in the code and it shapes like breaks your entire thought process. But I also think we can work on the syntax errors. I think there are a lot of syntax errors and I think that just comes in practice. And I think also because you're using Java, I personally use Python just because it's a lot simpler. But to each their own. Right? If you're faster with Java, then by all means stick with it. Yeah. And I think, like, I'm not sure, I guess, like I'm not too familiar with Java. So like I, I can't help you really with like whatever this message."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, but like writing using a sharepad, I think, like."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I. I think it should be like any IDE though. I don't. Maybe, maybe just because Shared pads down today, but you can give it a try, like another time. But it should be like any other ide, like programmers or whatever. Let's just try here. Let's see if this works."}, {"role": "user", "content": "There's a. Where's Java? There's a typo on the main issue. I think it's lowercase main."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Yeah. This probably just sharepath then. But I think we. We did have, like, a lot of syntax errors, which. Which is fine, but, like, I think, like, ideally, right, when you run your code, you want to be as smooth as possible. And, like, when you'vechecked the code, when you did the check, like, you were like, oh, is everything written correctly? We should have checked it then. Yeah, I. I didn't have to give any hints. You're pretty independent, which is good. Let's see. Was there anything else? Oh, Oh. I think at one point we're like. I think it's fine to, like, forget things here and there. Like, I think we forgot that we had to reverse it, Right. I think, like, when you are fall. When you're coding this, right. You had the. Like, you. I liked how you, like, approached it as if, like, without any code dots. Like, you were like, oh, I flip it upside down and I look at it reverse. Right. I think, like, don't lose track. I think that's like, an important train of thought to not lose. Like, if you ever get lost in the coding implementation, you can always return to, like, how would you approach it as a human. Right. And, yeah, I think, like, it's fine to forget things, but, like, don't forget that approach. And I think with practice, right, you won't get as, like, stressed or anything like that during, like, a technical or anything. So I think with practice, you would recall those things that you had came up with as a human in your human thought process. Yeah. But I think overall, I think this is a very strong baseline. And I think most of the students that I work with are like, take. It takes, like, a couple of interviews to get to this. So I think this is a very strong starting point for you. Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What legal difficulty is this question?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This isn't easy, but it is only for me to, like, for you and me to, like, form a baseline. And then from here, we'll ramp it up a little just so that you can have experience with. Like, if you were to struggle with a question, how would you ask and incorporate the interviewers, like, feedback and whatnot? Because ideally, like, the technical interview process is like, a chance for you to be collaborative with the interviewer. Right. It's for you and the interviewer to be like, oh, do I want to work with this person in a workplace? Right. And how you're able to, like, work together is like. Or this interview kind of shows how you. The two of you can work together. And Yeah, I mean, like, as the problems go, increase in difficulty. I'm sure, like, you get some practice with that, and I can also give you some pointers, and I'm sure you'll be fine. I think you're. Like I said, you have a strong baseline."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. Thanks for your time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, no problem. Do you have anything else that you wanted to discuss or any questions that you might have?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No, I think that's everything for today."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right. Yeah. Thank you. It's great meeting you, and I'll see you again. You may quit the interview now."}]}
